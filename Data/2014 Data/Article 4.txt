BJP 'day-dreaming' in their own world : Nitish Kumar

GOPALGANJ(BIHAR): In a scathing attack at BJP, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today said there was no wave in its favour in the coming Lok Sabha polls and the party is "day dreaming" in its own world.

"BJP workers are day dreaming in their own world...there is no wave in its favour for the general elections," Kumar said while addressing a JD(U) 'Sankalp rally' here.

Kumar blamed BJP for break up in alliance by violating the agreed principles - keeping off Article 370, uniform civil code and Ayodhya dispute - which could be solved either through court order or mutual talks between two communities.

"We had made it clear to them that the Prime Minister of the country should be a person who believes in inclusive growth and a vision to take backward states ahead," he said.

"We could not have betrayed our own conscience to keep others happy," he said to justify the decision to walk out of alliance with BJP 17 years after the elevation of Narendra Modi.

JD(U) had announced walking out of the NDA alliance and snapping ties with BJP on June 16 last year.

Kumar harped on special category status issue and exhorted people to give JD(U) enough strength in the general election for fulfilment of their demand.

Today's 'Sankalp rally' was part of JD(U) decision to organise 12 such rallies across the state to administer oath to people against communal forces and in favour of special category state demand.

Bihar JD(U) President Bashishtha Narayan Singh and several state ministers and leaders addressed the rally.
