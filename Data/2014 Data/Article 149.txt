Mayawati rubbishes interim budget, says it has nothing new

NEW DELHI: Rubbishing the last budget of the UPA government, BSP supremo Mayawati today said the interim budget has nothing new in it and has only listed UPA government's achievements in the last 10 years.

Though they have tried to make it an election budget, it is not going to benefit them, Mayawati said outside Parliament after the presentation of the vote-on-account in Parliament.

Finance Minister P Chidambaram presented the interim budget 2014-15 amid constant interruption by some members.

In a bid to boost growth in manufacturing sector, Chidambaram proposed to slash the excise duty on cars, SUVs and two-wheelers, and capital goods and consumer durables.

However, she said middle class will not get any benefit from it though the interim budget has made an attempt in this direction indirectly.

CPI leader D Raja said, "We should not read too much into the interim budget. Just before the elections they have to justify certain things and they have to blow up certain things".

Criticising the budget, Raja said government is slashing subsidy on food and fertilisers. "The economy is in deep crisis and it is going to be challenging for any government for any government that will come after the next election.

Maintaining that Chidambaram is not leaving behind a strong economy, Raja said, "He made some attempts for electoral appeal at the end of his speech but people are wise enough to understand the economic situation and cannot be hoodwinked by rhetoric at the fag end of the government."
