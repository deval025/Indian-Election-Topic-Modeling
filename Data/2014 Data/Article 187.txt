'Non Congress-non BJP parties to contest Lok Sabha polls together'

MUZAFFARNAGAR: CPIM General Secretary Prakash Karat said that non Congress-non BJP political parties would contest the Lok Sabha polls together to prevent communal forces coming at the Centre.

Eleven political parties, including SP, will held a meeting in Delhi on Feb 25 where they will decide their next course of action about formation of third front, Karat told newsmen at Jolla village near here last evening.

Alleging that corporate houses were creating an atmosphere for BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narender Modi to win, he said BJP is not an alternative to Congress.

Karat also met riot victims camping in Jolla village and announced to construct Ekta colony to rehabilitate them.

He laid the foundation stone for the project and said funds to a tune of Rs 54 lakh have been collected by his party workers for the building.
