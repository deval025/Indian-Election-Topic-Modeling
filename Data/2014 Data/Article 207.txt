No alliance with parties in touch with Congress: BJP

CHENNAI: BJP, which is holding parleys for a pre-poll alliance with actor-politician Vijayakanth's DMDK, today said it will not align with parties which are in touch with the Congress.

"BJP will not have any alliance with any party which is in touch in with Congress," senior party leader and in-charge of Tamil Nadu affairs, Muralidhar Rao, said.

He said the BJP was in touch with the DMDK, MDMK and PMK besides some other small parties and talks were in progress.

The BJP is taking its campaign in Tamil Nadu 'very seriously', he said, adding that the party is expecting a significant contribution from the state in forming the government at the centre after elections.

He said the BJP is "ready to associate" with the parties which are interested in forming an alternative government at the centre under the leadership of its Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi.
