Rahul Gandhi in UPA II government would have been good for Congress: Milind Deora

MUMBAI: Union Minister and Congress leader Milind Deora today said if Rahul Gandhi had joined the UPA government in 2009, it would have made a big difference to the fortunes of the party which is bracing for a tough electoral battle beginning next month.

"He would have brought a fresh approach in the government and the party's image would have been different. A party in power needs to use young leaders and their talent," Deora, who is seeking re-election from Mumbai South seat, told a news agency.

According to the 38-year-old MP, who hails from a political family, the Congress Vice-President's involvement as a minister would have brought the right mix of experience, wisdom, youth and enthusiasm in the government, which is now battling graft charges and perception of policy paralysis.
He did not agree with criticism that young MPs were not utilised effectively by his party.

"Many of us were given opportunities to serve in the government and also the party," the Minister of State for IT and Telecom said.
