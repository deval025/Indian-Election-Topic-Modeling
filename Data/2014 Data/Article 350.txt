Khurshid links RSS to Gandhi's assassination; BJP slams External Affairs Minister

NEW DELHI: Echoing Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi's viewpoint, External Affairs Minister Salman Khurshid linked RSS to Mahatma Gandhi's assassination. "RSS workers killed Mahatma Gandhi and after his assassination they distributed sweets in their homes", Khurshid said.

Khurshid, who was on a visit to his constituency, said that Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel had imposed a ban on the RSS.

The fresh salvo from Congress came under fire, with BJP launching a fierce attack on Khurshid for his remarks. BJP leader Siddharth Nath Singh said that Khurshid is making such statements rattled by BJP's popularity.

"Khurshid has seen writing on the wall. Congress is losing badly," Singh said. "Rattled by BJP's popularity he (Khurshid) is making these statements," Singh added.

Accusing Congress of trying to polarise voters, Singh said "The national character of RSS is well known. Congress is trying to polarise elections but voters won't fall for it."

While addressing a rally in Thane district of Maharashtra on March 6, the Congress Vice President had alleged that it was "RSS people" who had killed Mahatma Gandhi.

"RSS people killed Gandhiji and today their people (BJP) talk of him...They opposed Sardar Patel and Gandhiji," Rahul had said in his speech, drawing strong criticism from BJP and RSS.
