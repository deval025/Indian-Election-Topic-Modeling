General elections 2014: How did different classes vote across polls?

BJP has traditionally been seen as a party of the rich and the middle class, while Congress has usually been seen as a party which gets a greater share of votes from poorer sections of society. In 2004, this voting pattern was true to an extent - 31% of the rich supported Congress while over 42% of the rich supported BJP.

However, 2009 saw a distinct shift in vote shares across classes towards Congress, leading to far smaller differences in class support for the party. In contrast, BJP saw a decline in vote shares across income classes. Among other parties, the Left and BSP have usually seen greater support among poorer sections of the population.
