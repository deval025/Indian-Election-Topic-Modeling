Will approach court against Telangana creation: Jaganmohan Reddy

NEW DELHI: A day after Parliament approved the creation of Telangana as the country's 29th state, YSR Congress chief Jaganmohan Reddy today said his party would approach the court over the "undemocratic" division of Andhra Pradesh.

Observing that democracy was killed in broad daylight ever before, he said the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill 2014, was introduced undemocratically in the Lok Sabha.

"We will be approaching the courts," Jagan told reporters here.

"They have undemocratically shut the doors and have divided the state," he charged, referring to the blackout of Lok Sabha TV coverage when the crucial Telangana Bill was taken up in Lok Sabha.

Jagan further attacked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, saying his speech has failed to address various issues of Seemandhra region such as capital city, financial aid and water issues.

"The Prime Minister spoke about revenue deficit. He spoke about covering this gap for just one year. I wonder what is to happen to Seemandhra after this one year," he questioned.

On the announcement pertaining to special category status for a period of five years for Seemandhra, he said it would not serve the purpose as the time frame was very short.

Jagan was also critical of BJP, whose support in Parliament paved the way for bifurcating Andhra Pradesh.

"Unfortunately, they did not go against the voting. They also participated in the voting and voted for division," he noted.

He warned that any party with 270 MPs at the Centre may break any state in the country, according to their whims and fancies, as has happened in the case of Andhra Pradesh.
