Anna Hazare to meet Mamta Banerjee in Delhi on February 18; to campaign for Trinamool Congress

PUNE: Social activist Anna Hazare will campaign for Trinamool Congress candidates all over India in the forthcoming parliamentary elections, according to party General Secretary Mukul Roy.

Roy, who called on Hazare at his native village of Ralegan Siddhi in Ahmednagar district today, told PTI that Hazare would have a meeting with TMC chief Mamta Banerjee in Delhi on February 18.

The former Railway minister, Roy who met the anti-graft crusader as Mamta's emissary, said his party was "proud" of getting Hazare's support in a departure from his known stand of not canvassing for any political party in the elections.

"We feel proud that such a senior mass leader has hailed the leadership of Mamta Banerjee who had replied to his 17-point economic programme which is being incorporated in the party election manifesto," he added.

Roy quoted Hazare as saying that Mamta was an "honest leader committed to root out corruption".
