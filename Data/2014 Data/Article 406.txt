General elections 2014: BJP, Congress flash numbers to slug it out over job creation

NEW DELHI: The two main parties have got into a fight over job creation, a critical issue given the number of young people who will be looking to vote this time. The BJP criticized Congress on its record, describing rising unemployment as "the biggest failure of the UPA government". Congress argued that unemployment fell under its watch. Economists say BJP is closer to the real picture, although the data they're using is also questioned by some.

Senior BJP leader and deputy leader of the party in the Rajya Sabha Ravi Shankar Prasad cited National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) information to stress that while the NDA created 6.07 crore jobs in its six years, the UPA managed to add only 1.54 crore jobs till 2012. "With industrial production and manufacturing seriously crippled, it is no surprise that the UPA's record at job creation has been extremely poor," Prasad said.

Congress insisted that the BJP was incorrect. "It is not entirely accurate to use absolute numbers to compare specificities, since the NSSO notes that population estimation are approximate. Unemployment rate under the NDA went up from 7.3% in 1999-2000 to 8.3% in 2004-05. Under the UPA, it came down to 5.6%," said rural development minister Jairam Ramesh.

The Congress leader argued that between 2005 and 2012, employment in services, manufacturing and construction sectors had increased. "This suggests that the workforce is moving towards higher paying skilled professions," said Ramesh.

Economists said relying on NSSO data to determine employment figures is far from ideal.
