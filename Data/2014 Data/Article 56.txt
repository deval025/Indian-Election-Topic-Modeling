Migrants from UP, Bihar reason for Gujarat's prosperity: Akhilesh Yadav

LUCKNOW: Apparently hitting out at Gujarat Finance Minister Nitin Patel for blaming migrants for rise in poverty in his state, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav today said it was because of people from Bihar and UP that Gujarat was prospering.

"Some persons were saying that people from UP and Bihar were spreading poverty, but in reality it is due to them that there is prosperity in Gujarat," he said when asked to comment on Patel's remark after a cabinet meeting here.

If people from the two states return back from Mumbai then half of the city would get stalled. People from north India are running big units there, he said.

Patel had recently said that poor people from other states who come to Gujarat were included in state's BPL list, when queried about rising number of people in his state in below poverty line category.

On the poverty figure, Yadav said first the figures were presented by the Planning Commission and now by BJP.

"The poor people of the country will punish them in the time to come," he said adding that its them who decide who will form the next government not any industrial body.

The Chief Minister also said Gujarat and UP cannot be compared, saying his state was biggest in term of population.
