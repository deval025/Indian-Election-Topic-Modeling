Ramdev attacks Congress, backs Narendra Modi for PM

MUMBAI: Yoga guru Ramdev today attacked Congress while backing BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for the top post.

"My family used to vote for Congress. My grandfather used to vote for Congress. However, later he became blind. I told him that if you want to save yourself, stop voting for them," Ramdev said while addressing a press conference here.

"Unfortunately, some (political) sins were committed by our ancestors. They affected the entire country. It should not happen again," he said.

Ramdev said he met Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray and discussed defeating Congress.

Their aim, he said, was to get a stable and strong government at the Centre to root out corruption and bring back the black money stashed abroad.

Ramdev also took a dig at the Gujarat government on its poverty index figures.

"Be it any party, whoever is doing this (playing with figures), we oppose it. And we want that... poverty should be eradicated. Price rise and unemployment should be ended," he said.
