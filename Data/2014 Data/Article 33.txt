Non-Congress, non-BJP block based on programme, not person: Nitish Kumar

PATNA: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today said "positive" talks took place between 14 non-Congress and non-BJP parties for formation of a separate block in the Parliament which he said would be based on programme and not person.

"Very positive and good talks took place between the non-Congress and non-BJP parties for formation of a separate block in the Parliament," Kumar told reporters after a state cabinet meeting.

Kumar, who is playing an important role in the formation of the block, did not attend today's meeting at Delhi because of the cabinet meeting and other engagements here.

He said former Prime Minister and JDS leader H D Deve Gowda had told him about the meeting.

To dispel apprehensions about the future of such a group, which might become a casualty of personality clash, Kumar said, "It will be based on programme and not person."

Kumar is expected to be in Delhi on February 9, 10 and 11 during which he might meet some leaders of this new group.

Meanwhile, JD(U) president Sharad Yadav, who attended the meeting in Delhi today, told reporters that the "meeting of 14 parties to form a federal front was the second step after the anti-communal convention on October 30 last year".

"Today we took the second step to function collectively against pressing problems like price rise, corruption and unemployment gripping the country," he said at Patna Airport on arrival from Delhi this evening.

"Whatever name you give, but this is a federal front which will work collectively," the JD(U) chief, whose party is actively cooperating with the Left parties in forming the group of non-Congress and non-BJP parties, said.
