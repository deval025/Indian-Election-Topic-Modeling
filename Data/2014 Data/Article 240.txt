Lok Sabha polls are matter of life and death for BJP: Harsh Vardhan

NEW DELHI: Describing upcoming Lok Sabha polls as a matter of "life and death", Delhi BJP chief Harsh Vardhan today asked party workers to dedicate their maximum time to the party's campaigning to ensure all the seven seats for the party.

"This time the elections are decisive and historical. The great powers of the world are watching these elections," Vardhan said adding that for BJP this election is matter of life and death.

"If we want to make India a developed country then we have to make Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister of India," he told BJP workers.

He asked them to dedicate 18 hours of their day to ensure victory under the campaign 'Desh Ko Bachana Hai, Ek Naya Bharat Banana Hai'.

Attacking the AAP and Congress, Vardhan said,"In these Lok Sabha polls, all those powers which work to divide India at the instance of foreign countries and with the help of foreign money are fully active.

"After 2009, their numbers have increased to a dangerous level. These forces want to create anarchy and lawlessness in the entire country in the name of freedom of expression.

"Some parties indulge in the politics of religion, caste, class, community, region, language etc. and serve their self interest and in future also, they shall continue to do so," Vardhan said adding that it is the sacred duty of every party worker to caution the voters against these forces.
