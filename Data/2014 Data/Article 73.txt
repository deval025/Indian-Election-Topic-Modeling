Will offer conditional support to AAP: Narayan Desai

DELHI: A group of Gandhians, led by Narayan Desai, today said they will offer conditional support to the debutante Aam Aadmi Party.

"We will offer conditional support to Aam Aadmi Party till the elections. However, we will withdraw support if the party deviates from its initial ideology," Desai, son of Mahatma Gandhi's personal secretary and biographer Mahadev Desai, told reporters here.

Quizzed about the kind of support they will be offering, Desai said,"We will help them through our voter education programme."

However, Desai denied that entire Gandhian fraternity will extend its support to the party.

"I am talking about the ones who are present here. Rest might choose to differ," he said.

According to Desai, it is unfair to judge AAP on their one month's performance.

"One month or for that matter few months are too short to judge any party's performance. We would like to give Arvind Kejriwal some time to prove the party's capabilities and positive agendas," he said.

Asked about his opinion about the party's chances of performing well in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, Desai said, "They might or might not get majority of votes. But depending too much on numbers can be dangerous. Truth may not always be with the majority."
