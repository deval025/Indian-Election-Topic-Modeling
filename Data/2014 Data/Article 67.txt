Jan Lokpal: Anna Hazare supports Arvind Kejriwal on threat to resign

NEW DELHI: Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today received support from Anna Hazare on his threat to resign if the Jan Lokpal Bill is not passed in the Delhi Assembly.

Kejriwal met Hazare at Maharashtra Sadan here to inform him about the AAP government's plan to introduce Jan Lokpal and Swaraj bills in the assembly.

After his meeting with Kejriwal, Hazare told reporters, "He (Kejriwal) should resign if it is not passed, he should do that."

He was asked whether he supported the Chief Minister on his threat to resign if the legislation is not passed in the assembly.

On the proposed legislation, the activist said, "I have not seen the paper (Jan Lokpal Bill) but what he (Kejriwal) said is good. When I see the paper, I can tell more. But whatever he has told me sounds good. It is good."

To a poser on whether he will support Kejriwal's agitation in case he resigns, Anna said he would not be able speak on the issue now.

"Will decide on it later...I do not wish to get involved in politics with Aam Aadmi Party and Congress. We will wait and watch AAP's further action," he said.
After meeting Anna, Kejriwal reiterated his threat to resign saying "if I have to resign a hundred times, then also I will resign."

He said his meeting with Anna was about the two proposed bills and it was not a "political" affair.


"I was here to inform Anna on Jan Lokpal and Swaraj bills. I was not here for any political purpose. He (Anna) was my guru and he is my guru," the Delhi Chief Minister said.
