Poll manifestos remain relevant to get glimpse into thinking of national parties

Apart from a clutch of regional and Left parties, only the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has released its manifesto for the Lok Sabha elections. The Congress and the BJP could do so soon. But at a time of saturation media coverage and ubiquitous internet on smart phones, tablets and other devices, do manifestos matter? Do pre-election promises, tailored to attract voters, hold up when parties come to office?

The AAP claims to have little ideological baggage and says it is willing to adjust policy to ground reality. Despite that, or perhaps because of it, its manifesto, as this column pointed out on Tuesday, is peppered with contradictions and good intentions.

For all their ambiguities, the BJP and Congress have lined up on either side of the secularism debate. In power, their economic policies have tended to converge, even as they remain divided over social issues. Both parties go into the 2014 elections under relatively new leaders: Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi.

Despite their many rallies and engagements with people, little is known of their policy preferences. What would Modi’s foreign policy look like? What does Gandhi think about the specifics and direction of economic reform?

So election manifestos remain relevant. We need the two national parties to tell us, unambiguously, where they stand on all issues confronting the country. Granted, that all promises made in a manifesto are unlikely to be kept. However, the documents will give us, the voters of India, a glimpse into the current thinking of the two national parties.

The BJP’s manifesto is being drafted by a committee of experts; Gandhi wants to crowd source ideas from every aspect of society and distil them into the document. We wait to see the two documents and the ideas of India they represent.
