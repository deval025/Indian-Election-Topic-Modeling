Congress isolated in Tamil Nadu as parties gear up for Lok Sabha polls

CHENNAI: As the Sri Lankan Tamils issue and attack on state fishermen dominated the political scene in Tamil Nadu ahead of the April 24 Lok Sabha polls, Congress finds itself isolated in the electoral race with almost all parties choosing to stay away from it.

With former ally DMK virtually shutting the doors and DMDK inching towards BJP; Congress, which used to ride piggyback on either of the two major Dravidian parties -- DMK or AIADMK, is starring at a repeat of the 1998 scenario when it was left to fend itself. The party then drew a blank.

Congress' predicament, in the backdrop of corruption charges against the UPA Government headed by it, has become acute with the party's stand opposing the release of seven convicts in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.

If AIADMK supremo and Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa stole a march over others by directing the release of the seven life convicts, including Murugan, Santhan, Perarivalan and Nalini, other parties including her arch rival DMK have welcomed it even as Tamil outfits are rejoicing over her move.

Congress was also at pains to give a convincing explanation over Prime Minister Manmohan Singh meeting Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapakse on the sidelines of the BIMSTEC in Myanmar yesterday, which has been already opposed by DMK and Tamil outfits.

The meeting had come in the backdrop of growing clamour in the state for an India-sponsored separate resolution in the UNHRC against Sri Lanka for alleged war crimes. India had voted in support of earlier US-sponsored resolutions on the same issue.

DMK, Congress' key ally since 2004 prior to the break-up in March last year over the Sri Lankan Tamils issue, had already ruled out reviving the alliance.

Party chief M Karunanidhi has said all doors were shut on more allies, putting an end to speculations of a patch-up following senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad calling on him here recently.
