Opposition must allow parliament to function, pass crucial bills

Opposition parties should not stall the legislative work of Parliament in the last session ahead of the 2014 polls. Many crucial pieces of legislation, including the creation of a separate state of Telangana and six anti-graft laws, have been listed for passage by the 15th Lok Sabha, that has earned the dubious distinction of being the worst-performing House since Independence.

The Opposition must take a large part of the blame. The people of India elect their representatives and expect them to make and change laws and hold the government to account. Failure to discharge their responsibility means dereliction of duty. Also, blocking the functioning of Parliament amounts to subverting the idea of a participative democracy.

The government and Speaker Meira Kumar have urged all parties to let Parliament complete its business. However, most parties are unwilling to relent, except for the passage of the vote on account.

Thatâ€™s irresponsible. Parliament must pass the Bill to carve the state of Telangana out of Andhra Pradesh. A new state has been a long-pending demand by the people of the region, and the BJP has, in principle, supported statehood that will help improve the backward region. Why dither now? The Opposition should also agree to cooperate in passing other important pieces of economic legislation cleared by various standing committees.

ABill pending since 2003 in the Rajya Sabha seeks to remove state monopoly over coal mining. India is woefully short of power. Therefore, allowing the private sector to mine and trade in coal will augment supplies to the power sector. There is no reason why the BJP, that claims to be pro-reform, cannot ensure its passage. Let lawmakers change archaic laws to foster growth. That, after all, is their job.
