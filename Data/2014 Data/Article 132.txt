Will launch campaign to 'expose the lies' of AAP: Congress

NEW DELHI: Delhi Congress today said it will launch a series of agitations in the city to "expose the lies" through which Aam Aadmi Party had come to power.

Slamming AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal for stepping down as the chief minister, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee chief Arvinder Singh Lovely said, "Kejriwal has insulted the people of Delhi with his resignation... It (his decision to step down) was in order to hide his failures and fool the people in the name of the Jan Lokpal Bill."

Addressing a meeting of local party leaders to chalk out an action plan against AAP, Singh said, "Congress will finalise a programme of action for the agitation against AAP tomorrow. It will expose the lies of AAP leaders by organising forceful agitations."

He further charged that, in his 49 days in power, Kejriwal had broken all records of telling lies.

"AAP created such a situation in Delhi in 49 days that people's livelihoods came to a halt and the power and water situation worsened.

"He is again trying to mislead the people in the name of the Jan Lokpal Bill, though the truth is that the Bill was not even introduced in the Assembly," Singh said.

At the meeting, Congress leader Mukesh Sharma introduced a resolution condemning Kejriwal's style of politics.

The resolution added that Kejriwal should be held responsible if people got inflated power and water bills from April 1.
