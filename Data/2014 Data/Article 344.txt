Govt 'laid back' about appointing Navy Chief: BJP

NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over the Navy chief's post lying vacant for nearly a month, BJP today attacked the Congress-led UPA government for its "laid back" approach in filling up the top post and said it may lead to compromise on national security.

"Reports have shown that for over a month the naval chief's position is remaining vacant. This government which shows undue hurry in filling bureaucratic positions has shown a very laid back approach which may lead to a compromise on national security in as much as delaying the appointment of a naval chief," party spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman told reporters.

A spate of accidents involving the Naval warships had claimed the job of Navy Chief Admiral D K Joshi who quit the top post taking moral responsibility of the incidents.

The resignation of 59-year-old Joshi, who had about 15 months more left in service, had come hours after submarine INS Sindhuratna had a mishap off the coast of Mumbai in which seven sailors were taken seriously ill and two officers were missing.

The BJP had earlier also demanded the resignation of Defence Minister A K Antony asking him to take moral responsibility for a series of accidents involving naval warships.
The party had said that the ten naval accidents in past ten months have showed the bad state of affairs in which the navy was functioning.

Attacking the government, BJP had alleged that the UPA government was responsible for consistently neglecting the vital arm of the defence forces.
