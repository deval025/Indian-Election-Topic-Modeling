Rahul Gandhi blames opposition for non-passage of anti-graft Bills

NEW DELHI: As parliament session came to an end, Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi today made a sharp attack on opposition parties alleging there "deceit" had ensured that key anti-corruption Bills could not be passed

"Those in the opposition have said that they are against corruption and want to fight it. But when the time came to pass the Bills against corruption, they did not support," Gandhi told mediapersons.

He said people were now saying the ordinance route be taken to bring in these anti-graft measures and he had talked to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi in this regard.

"Let us see if the ordinance can be brought or not. But in a way, the opposition deceived. Opposition ka dhokha hai," Gandhi said.

The Congress Vice President said he had said several times that that action is more important than words and the reality was that the opposition did not extend support when it was time to act to bring anti corruption measures.

"I thought the people in the opposition will support these Bills and India will get a strong anti-graft mechanism. But they didn't do so," Gandhi said.
