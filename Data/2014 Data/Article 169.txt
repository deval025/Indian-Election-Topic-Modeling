Congress questions Mamata Banerjee's meeting with Anna Hazare

KOLKATA: Congress in West Bengal today criticised Anna Hazare's meeting with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, wondering if the Gandhian would agree to hold a dharna here for the victims of Saradha Chit Fund scam.

"I wonder whether Anna Hazare, who claims to be an anti-corruption crusader, is aware of the Saradha chit fund scam that has robbed people of their life-long savings," State Congress leader Manas Bhuniya said.

Hazare had a few days ago declared his support for Mamata Banerjee, who has ambitions to take her party outside Bengal in coming Lok Sabha election, and snubbed one-time protege Arvind Kejriwal.

"We have been demanding a CBI inquiry to investigate Saradha Scam. Will Anna Hazare support us in demanding a CBI inquriy into Saradha scam so that crores of duped investors can get justice?" Bhuniya said.

"Will Anna come down to Kolkata and sit on a hunger strike in front of the Gandhi statue? If not, then the face and the mask of Anna will come out in the open," Bhuniya said.
