AAP receives Rs 29 lakh in donations after Arvind Kejriwal’s resignation

NEW DELHI: Arvind Kejriwal’s decision to resign as Delhi chief minister has brought an abrupt end to the Aam Aadmi Party’s rule in the capital, but it has helped boost the flow of funds to the party’s coffers.

Online donations for the party’s Lok Sabha campaign have picked up after Kejriwal and his cabinet resigned on late Friday after his government failed to push through the Jan Lokpal Bill in the Delhi assembly.

The party received more than Rs 29.32 lakh in donation on Saturday from as many as 1,150 people. On the previous day, 593 people had donated as much as Rs 11.75 lakh.

The numbers are far higher than the rest of February when daily donations ranged from Rs 2.0 lakh to Rs3.5 lakh.

Most of the funds in the past couple of days have come from within the country, mainly from state such as Delhi, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka.

ET has not independently verified the data provided by Upadhyay, a former journalist and statistician who said he is now working with AAP's central IT cell.

Donations to the party had fallen perceptibly since news emerged that Somnath Bharti, the minister for law in Kejriwal’s government, raided the residences of African nationals in the Khirki Extension neighbourhood during the midnight of January 15. A sit-in protest led by Kejriwal that turned central Delhi into a warzone further dented the party’s image, choking donations that had been pouring in since the party formed the government in Delhi.
