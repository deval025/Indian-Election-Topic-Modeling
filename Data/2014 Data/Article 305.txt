BJP launches Raksha app to aid women security

NEW DELHI: Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday launched the Raksha app, meant to aid women security in the country. The app, which was conceptualized by BJP's national spokesperson Meenakshi Lekhi, allows its user to alert a chosen set of contacts about one's location.

"The selected contacts can see your location and you can even ask them to show theirs. A distress signal can be sent by pressing a single key," the statement says. "A loud buzzer sound is sent out to your chosen contacts," the statement adds.

The Rakhsa app is meant to function even while it is switched off. "Pressing the volume key for just three seconds alerts the specific contacts you have chosen beforehand. Your location is sent to them on a map which sends them your exact whereabouts," the statement claims.

The salient features of the Raksha app include; send location without switching on the Raksha app, create group of trusted people who you can alert if required, map view for navigation, buzzer.
