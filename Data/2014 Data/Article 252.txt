'BJP-RSS's politics of individualism dangerous for democracy'

JAIPUR: Hitting out at BJP and RSS over their "single-line objective" of promoting Narendra Modi as their prime ministerial candidate, CPI-M today said such policy of "individualism" was dangerous for Indian democracy.

"Individualism priority in elections poses as danger to democracy as voters are compelled through mass media not to think of any other candidate," CPI(M) central secretariat member Hannan Mollah said during a press conference here.

In an apparent attack on Modi, Mollah said Gujarat model cannot be made country's model rather a national pattern should be created which is acceptable to all states.

Commenting on the clash between Aam Aadmi Party and BJP leaders in Delhi, the CPI-M leader said what kind of democracy do they want to bring in the country.

Mollah, who attended the state CPI-M committee meeting held on March 4-5 here, said the party would field three candidates in Rajasthan from Churu, Sikar and Sriganganagar parliamentary seats.

He further said that the party might think to field a fourth candidate from Dungarpur if Rajasthan Loktantrik Jan Morcha, comprising of SP, JD-U, JD-S, CPI, CPM, permitted.

Mollah criticised the Vasundhra Raje-led state government over its "faulty policy" of relief measures to farmers after the recent hailstorms which damaged their crops.

"Every farmer whose crop perished should be given relief package," Mollah, accompanied by state CPI-M secretary Vasudeo, said.
