National Fish Workers Forum`s plea to parties fighting Lok Sabha poll

PUDUCHERRY: The National Fish Workers Forum today asked national and state level political parties contesting the Lok Sabha polls to ensure that their respective parties` poll manifestos paid attention to the welfare of fishermen.

NFF Chairman M.Ilango in a release alleged that hardly any political party had concentrated on the predicament of the fishermen during the last six and half decades.

"It is therefore the duty of the NFF to bring to the attention of the leaders of the political outfits, both national and regional, the charter of demands of the fishermen. These pleas should be accommodated in the poll manifestos for follow up action post polls," he said.

He said the demand for a separate ministry to address the welfare of fishermen had fallen on deaf ears and there had also been no representation for fishermen in the central cabinet.

He said political parties should not treat fishermen as mere vote banks, but should ensure representation to them in the central cabinet. The parties should also offer opportunities to fishermen to contest the polls.
