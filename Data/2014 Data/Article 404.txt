Sonia Gandhi slams Narendra Modi; says opposition shedding 'crocodile tears'

NEW DELHI: Upping the ante against Congress's main adversary BJP, party president Sonia Gandhi on Monday said that the opposition is shedding 'crocodile tears' to woo voters. At a rally in Mewat, Haryana, Sonia also urged voters not to be influenced by the 'tall claims' made by opposition parties.

Playing down accusations of not delivering on promises made in 2009, Sonia Gandhi said, "Everyone can see the development work done by Congress. Our history speaks for ourself". She also added, "No government has worked as much for the country as Manmohan Singh's."

Gandhi raked up the issue of secularism and said that Congress will work to make India a secular country, where being an Indian is above everything else. Hitting out BJP, she asked, "Can those who divide the nation ever work for its progress?"

"This Constitution recognises our secular values and teaches us how to respect them," she said, in a veiled attack on BJP and its prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi.

In a retort, Gandhi said, "BJP is trying to mask its dark deeds behind its development model". She said, "BJP is misleading people only to see Modi on the PM's chair." "Congress doesn't believe in a government which is run by a few. India should not be ruled by any one man, since it belongs to each and every citizen," she added.

She said Congress manifesto also promises right to health for everyone, even as it has fulfilled its promises on rural job scheme, implementation of Right to Education and RTI, besides stringent law to stop violence against women.

In a recent overhaul of strategy, Congress wants Sonia Gandhi to play an active role in poll campaigning. Till now, she had been on the sidelines, while the Congress Vice President, Rahul Gandhi had been steering the campaign
