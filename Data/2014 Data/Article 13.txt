Rajasthan Kisan Union announces support for AAP in Lok Sabha polls

JAIPUR: Rajasthan Kisan Union, a non-political farmers organisation, today announced to support the Aam Aadmi Party in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

The union, led by Krishna Kumar Saharan, today took out a rally of tractors participated by around 500 farmers from across the state.

"Both BJP and Congress have betrayed the farmers every time. They made promises but did nothing for the welfare of farmers, so we have decided to support the Aam Aadmi Party," Saharan said at a joint press conference here.

"These parties (Congress and BJP) promote leaders who have nothing to do with Rajasthan. BJP has this time made Vijay Goel a Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan, earlier there was Ram Jethmalani. Earlier, Congress had made Anand Sharma Rajya Sabha MP from the state," he said.

Saharan said the system needed to be changed and the AAP would play a key role in it. "Our education system needs drastic change. Similarly, many of today's laws need amendment and AAP will do that," he said.

"Our union has a strong network in all villages, and we will spread awareness at panchayat and village level to bring in a radical change," Saharan said.

AAP state convener Ashok Jain said the party aims to register 10 lakh members across the state in a special membership drive from February 1 to February 15.

The party plans to bring 1.4 crore people to its ambit before the Lok Sabha elections. The Aam Aadmi Party today convened its state council meet and discussed its strategy for the upcoming elections.
