Congress MPs in Well to demand extension of Winter Session

NEW DELHI: With Rahul Gandhi pitching for passage of anti-corruption bills pending in Parliament, Congress members in the Lok Sabha today trooped into the Well demanding extension of the Winter Session to pass the measures.

As the House was taking up 'matter of urgent public importance', several Congress members rushed to the Well holding placards listing out bills they want to be passed.

They were countered by Samajwadi Party members, who said the bills could have been passed long back as UPA is in power for 10 years.

The bills listed by Congress members on the placards included the Communal Violence Prevention Bill, Whistleblowers' Protection Bill and SC/ST Reservation Bill.

While Congress members shouted slogans demanding extending the ongoing session by a week, SP members said it was time to go for elections and let people decide on who stemmed corruption.

They also said a government allegedly involved in 2G, Adarsh housing and coal scams should not talk of anti-graft measures.

Unfazed by the din, presiding officer Francisco Sardina continued with the proceedings.

Earlier, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath urged opposition parties to extend the session so that the bills, pending in both Houses of Parliament, can be passed.
