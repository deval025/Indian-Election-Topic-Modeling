Narendra Modi: Polls not about arithmetic of seats, but BJP's chemistry with people

NEW DELHI: Raising a fierce poll pitch in Assam, BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi on Monday slammed Congress President Sonia Gandhi for playing 'politics of survival'. "Congress has crossed all limits of mis-rule in the last decade," Modi said.

"Congress leaders are not bothered about people. They are not concerned if people live or die. They only think about their own survival," Modi accused.

Taking a dig at Sonia Gandhi, Modi said, "You (Sonia Gandhi) promised to curb inflation within 100 days, did that happen? You say that other parties are making false promises, what about you party and its promises." "Does Congress need 'Muhurt' to control price rise?" Modi asked.

Terming the Lok Sabha polls as a matter of 'chemistry and not arithmetic, Modi said, "Someone asked me what do you think about elections. I said that +2%, +few seats is ok from arithmetic point of view, but this poll is about BJP's chemistry with people!"

On Sunday, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi launched a scathing attack on Narendra Modi, saying those who don't believe in secular values cannot grasp the spirit of patriotism, and will lead the country to destruction if they get power.

"Some people are beating the drum of patriotism... You tell me if those who don't believe in secular values can grasp the spirit of patriotism? No, they can't. They want to grab power for themselves and their people by misleading you," she said.

The BJP's ideology spreads extremism, "divides" society and pits one brother against another while Congress believed in keeping the society together and looks at everybody as one.

"Congress wishes well to even its adversaries," she said. She termed Lok Sabha polls as the clash between two ideologies and asked people to defeat the BJP's "extremist and divisive ideology".
