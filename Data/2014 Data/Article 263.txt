Rahul Gandhi supports demand for separate fisheries ministry

MUMBAI: Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi today met representatives of the fishing community who put forth various demands pertaining to their business like need for a separate ministry, farming status for fisheries and more subsidies on diesel.

In a 40-minute interaction held at Versova fishing village which falls in Mumbai North West parliamentary constituency of CWC member Gurudas Kamat, fishing community representatives highlighted their demands and expressed fear that with land costs in Mumbai spiralling, builders were eyeing sprawling fish markets.

"We want to know on whose side are you?" they asked the Congress leader.

"I will always be with you," Rahul replied adding that he had come to meet them and understand their views and not give a speech.

Supporting the demand for a separate fisheries ministry, he said that it was a good suggestion.

When Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan intervened to say that there is budgetary provision of about Rs 1,600 crore for the animal husbandry ministry, under which the fisheries department falls, one of the locals said all agriculture ministers the state has seen are not from the coastal region and do not understand the nitty gritties of fishing business.

"They have no information of the sea. Like farmers, we do not get compensation, if there is drought (poor cache of fish in the sea)," another speaker pointed out.

There was also a demand for expansion of the Sasoon Docks in South Mumbai. Another local highlighted the need for loans from nationalised banks at low interest rate.

"Fishing is not a 12-month business. We need alternative jobs for livelihood," said one speaker.
