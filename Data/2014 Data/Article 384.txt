Mamata Banerjee attacks Rahul Gandhi

NAXALBARI: In a no-holds barred attack on Rahul Gandhi without naming him, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee today dubbed the Congress vice-president "an upstart leader" who did not know his facts correctly.

"Upstart leaders from Delhi are saying a lot of funds are provided to West Bengal. Do you know accounts? Did you ever do it and do you know what work is? Do you know how funds come and are spent and how they are returned," Banerjee, the West Bengal Chief Minister, told an election rally here.

"I challenge it. I do not want to take names. I feel ashamed. I name such persons who are worthy to be named. I do not name those who are not worthy of it.

"They are the sons and daughters of latsahebs and zamindars who do not know about the poor and suffering. You (Congress) were in power for 66 years," she said.

She also referred to Gandhi as a cuckoo which was seen only at certain times of the year.

"Throughout the year, I am with the people. I know their problems and they know me. I am not like the proverbial cuckoo that arrives in spring and disappears once the season is over," she said.
