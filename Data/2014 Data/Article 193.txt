Rahul Gandhi in North East, BJP has questions for him

NEW DELHI: As Rahul Gandhi addressed rallies in North East, BJP today questioned whether he shares responsibility for lack of development, growing insurgency and discrimination against students and people from there in Delhi.

"Does Rahul Gandhi accept responsibility for consistent violence and prejudice against North-Eastern students and people in Delhi, which was ruled by his party for last 15 years?," BJP Spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said.

He also questioned his position on illegal immigrants from Bangladesh flooding the north-East. "Why did Congress promote this infiltration, which has caused social and demographic change in the North-East?"

Accusing the Congress of never uttering a single word on the issue, he said, "You are promoting illegal infiltration which must be banned...You have vested interests in insurgency."

The BJP leader also sought to question the Congress Vice President on why infrastructure like roads, rail, power and telecom in North-East is in shambles even though many of the states and the Centre is ruled by Congress.

Claiming historic turnouts for Narendra Modi's rallies in the North-East, Javadekar said the support reflects the anger of the states there against Congress and also saluting the historic initiatives taken by NDA Government.

"Congress has panicked and that is why Rahul Gandhi has rushed (to North East)," he said.

The BJP leader said that during Atal Behari Vajpayee's rule, the former Prime Minister had ensured 10 pc allocation of resources from all Ministries, set up a Ministry for North -Eastern affairs and mandated 10 pc flights of all Airlines to North-East, which increased connectivity.

"BJP seeks answers from Rahul Gandhi before his visit to the North-East," he said.
