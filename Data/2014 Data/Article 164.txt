Parties, MPs went back on their word on Telangana issue: Ghulam Nabi Azad

NEW DELHI: With Parliament having cleared the Telangana Bill amidst uproar, Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad today said it was unfortunate that many parties and MPs, even from Congress, who had initially supported the creation of the new state later began opposing it.

"It is most unfortunate even our MPs, while I was having discussions with them, those who are now opposing and those who have been suspended, they were saying we leave it to the high command. Whatever they will decide, we will go by that. But once we decided, everybody went back," he said.

The minister said the confusion over the issue was because many parties and individuals had given wrong assurances.

"It is not our fault. It is the fault of those people who had given wrong assurances to us and after a decision was taken by Congress and the Cabinet, they had gone back (on their word)," he said.

Azad said that Congress had committed itself to creation of the new state.
