Don't fall into BJP's trap, Nitish Kumar tells voters in Bihar

MOTIHARI :Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today said that the BJP has no development model for Bihar and appealed the people not to fall in its 'trap' to garner votes in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections.

Appealing people not to pay heed to the BJP's 'rumours' that the JD(U) has no stake in the polls, Kumar said that its propaganda of "an apostle coming from the sky" to solve Bihar's problems, was only a ploy to get votes.

"Development in Bihar can only be done by a native... The propaganda that an apostle coming from the sky will solve all our problems is aimed at merely getting votes," Kumar said at a 'Sankalp Yatra' here in East Champaran district.

"The leader will get your vote befooling you and will not turn up for the rest of the period for any development work for the people here," Kumar said.

Taking a dig at BJP's growing closeness to Raj Thackrey's MNS, Kumar said nowadays they were busy "shaking hands with people who have been targeting people from Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh in Maharashtra."

He also questioned BJP's motif in the state's demand for a special category status saying that the party had actually joined hands with the Congress to facilitate the same to Seemandhra "within 24 hours" of Sonia Gandhi's instruction.

"Why did not they made a similar demand for Bihar before supporting Congress in the passage of Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Bill?" he said.

Meanwhile, Kumar declared former BJP MLA Awnish Kumar Singh, who recently joined JD(U), as the party's Lok Sabha candidate from Motihari seat.
