Be much more careful in choosing words: Brinda Karat to Sushma Swaraj

RANCHI: CPI(M) Politburo member Brinda Karat today asked BJP leader Sushma Swaraj to be "much more careful" while expressing solidarity with any victim.

"When she (Swaraj) was speaking about the Nirbhaya case, she had described the rape victim as 'jinda lash (comatose)'. And now when she is again expressing solidarity with the Northeast people, she has used derogatory description (inadvertently)," Brinda said here.

"She has to be much more careful with her language," the she said while reacting to the Leader of the Opposition's reported unintentional choice of words while the Lok Sabha condemned the killing of Nido Taniam of Arunachal Pradesh in New Delhi.
