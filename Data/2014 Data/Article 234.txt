Populism over fiscal austerity: Haryana government presents tax free budget, eye on 2014 elections

CHANDIGARH: Predictably opting for populism over fiscal austerity, Haryana finance minister Harmohinder Singh Chattha on Friday recommended no new tax provisions in the budget for 2014-15. In a year that will see both assembly and general elections, he recommended liberal allocations to fund social schemes, new jobs, enhanced salaries and wages, to fulfil the Bhupinder Singh Hooda government’s promises.

“Spending will surpass means debt,” Chattha told ET on the budget that projected revenue deficit of Rs 5,012.57 crore for the next fiscal, over a revised estimate of Rs 5,612.92 for the current fiscal.

Fiscal deficit has been estimated at Rs 1,1393.29 crore for the next fiscal, compared to Rs 1,1515.61, according to budget estimates of 2014-15.

An outlay of Rs 32,731.29 crore was made in the Annual Plan 2014-15, compared to Rs 24,182.42 crore proposed for revenue estimates for 2013-14. This outlay includes an amount of Rs 10,158.80 crore of state public sector enterprises (PSEs) and Rs 10,52.34 crore of local bodies to be met from their own resources.

“After excluding outlay of PSEs and local bodies, the net state plan outlay for the year 2014-15 is proposed at Rs 21,520.15 crore, including Central assistance,” said parliamentary affairs minister Randeep Singh Surjewala. “With over 35.35% hike in plan, it’s a record for any state. Given the fact that Haryana lacks natural resources and is land-locked state, the budget is brilliant work of fiscal prudency and financial management,” said Surjewala, who also holds the industry & commerce portfolio.
The state is projected to grow better than the national rate, according to the Haryana Economic & Statistical Analysis Department that estimated 6.9% growth in 2013-14.

The Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Haryana continues to grow at a pace much faster than the national GDP. It is estimated that during the Eleventh Five Year Plan period,that is 2007-2012, the state economy registered an average growth of 8.7% compared to the national average growth of 8%.

Haryana’s GSDP for 2013-14 at current prices is estimated at Rs 3,92,894.05 crore, compared to Rs 2,23,600.25 crore in 2009-10. At constant prices, with base year prices of 2004-05, GSDP increased from Rs 1,52,474.47 crore in 2009-10 to an estimated Rs 2,01,077.08 crore in 2013-14. “Per capita income in Haryana is the highest in the country amongst large states. Only two small states, Goa and Sikkim, have per capita income higher than us,” said the finance minister.

Total revenue receipts are expected at Rs 47,690.14 crore in 2014-15, compared to the revised estimates of Rs 41,635.94 for 2013-14. “Budget projects an 11% increase in VAT,” principal secretary Rajan Gupta told ET.

Budget estimates of 2014-15 also peg total revenue receipts at Rs 47,690.14 crore, a growth of 14.54%. Revenue expenditure for RE 2013-14 is projected to be Rs 47,248.86 crore and for BE 2014-15, it is estimated to be Rs 52,702.71 crore, of which estimated expenditure on salaries is Rs 14,736.52 crore, Rs 4,500 crore on pensions and Rs 7,138.89 crore on interest payments.

Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda’s earlier announcement of 65,000 new jobs will use up a major part of the allocation and also burden the exchequer, post implementation of the Seventh Pay Commission.

Salary and pension expenditure is pegged at 19,237 crore for 2014-15, compared to revised estimate of Rs 16,310 crore in 2013-14. “There will be 14% increase in salary and pension expenditure,” said principal secretary Gupta.

To keep its commitment to the Fiscal Responsibility & Budgetary Management (FRBM) Act, 2005, the finance minister allocated Rs 4,500 crore as power subsidy. “We will make additional allocations later. The power regulatory commission has sanctioned Rs 4,500 crore for the time being,” he added.

In sectoral allocations for 2014-15, both Plan and Non-Plan, agriculture and allied sectors would receive Rs 2,156.31 crore.
