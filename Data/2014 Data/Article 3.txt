Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal to send notice to Kejriwal on corruption allegations
KANPUR: A day after Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal named him in a list of corrupt politicians, Coal Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal today hit out at him saying he did not need any certificate from any leader or party on probity.
Jaiswal said he would send a notice to Kejriwal over the allegations and demanded reply within 72 hours failing which he would go for legal action.

"I will send a legal notice to him today demanding response within 72 hours. After that I will initiate legal action," Jaiswal told reporters here.

"I don't need certificate of probity from any party or leader. The people of this region will certify whether I am corrupt or not," he said.

Unnao MP, Annu Tandon, whose name also figures in Kejriwal's corrupt list, said these were gimmicks of new parties and leaders who wanted to be in the news.

"There is no truth in these allegations. The people of Unnao know well about my probity," she said, adding that those who were making allegations of corruption against her should ask the "aam janata" (masses) and they will tell the truth.
