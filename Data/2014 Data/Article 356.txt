Corruption being blown out of proportion: Sam Pitroda

BANGALORE: Chairman of National Innovation Council Sam Pitroda feels that corruption has become a way of life in Indian society and it was being blown out of proportion.

"I think lot of this corruption is blown out of proportion. First of all, let me tell you - not that I like corruption, don't get me wrong, corruption is a way of life in our society," Pitroda told reporters replying to a question on corruption being a big issue for UPA government today.

Speaking at "Meet the Press", organised by the Bangalore Press Club and the Reporters Guild of Bangalore, he said that it was not that any party was corrupt or not, but everybody in the society was corrupt.

"Business is corrupt, teachers are corrupt, doctors are corrupt, politicians are corrupt, everybody is corrupt. Not just the Indian society is corrupt, there is corruption in US but it is sophisticated. As it is sophisticated, you and I don't get affected directly. There is corruption in China, Japan, Russia - so it has became a way of life, not that I like it. But let's not get hung-up on it," he said.

Pitroda said that one can't stop doing things just because there was corruption. "If somebody is corrupt, action should be taken... but you can't take 20 year to decide it. Fix it soon, three years or whatever."

He stressed on the need to improve the system slowly and said if somebody has done wrong then he should pay for it; each one of us has to take responsibility...so I think we will have to work with the system we have and slowly and slowly improve."
