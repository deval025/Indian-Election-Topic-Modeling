Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi challenges Arvind Kejriwal on corruption charges

GUWAHATI: Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi today challenged his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal to prove his accusation that he is "corrupt".

Reacting to Kejriwal's list of "corrupt politicians" where his name is included, Gogoi told PTI here, "Let him prove I am corrupt".

"The people of Assam have never accused me of being corrupt. There is no corruption case ever filed against me by the vigilance," Gogoi asserted.
"Let Kejriwal put up candidates in the elections in Assam as he has said, and the people of Assam will give a fitting reply," he said.

Targeting Rahul Gandhi, Kejriwal today accused Gogoi among others of being corrupt and stated he would field candidates against them.
