UPA responsible for common man's woes: Nitin Gadkari

CHANDIGARH: Former BJP chief Nitin Gadkari today alleged wrong economic policies and poor governance of the Congress-led UPA government at the Centre were responsible for people's woes.

"The common man is suffering because of Congress-led government's wrong economic policies, poor governance and visionless leadership," he told party workers here.

Despite ruling the country for nearly 58 years, the Congress had failed to improve the lot of masses, Gadkari said.
Asking voters to oust the UPA government in upcoming Lok Sabha polls, the BJP leader said the NDA would bring good governance in the country.

On BJP's vision document, he said "our party's dream is to make India a superpower. We will introduce a totally transparent system and will adopt progressive economic policies."

Special emphasis would be given to e-governance which could curb red tapism, he said.

Attacking those dubbing the BJP as "communal", Gadkari said "the BJP is the only secular party which wants upliftment of all sections of society."
