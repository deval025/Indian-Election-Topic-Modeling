Clean Yamuna: Hema Malini's top priority after elections

MATHURA: Hema Malini, BJP's Lok Sabha candidate from Mathura, has said that eliminating pollution from Yamuna will be her top priority.

"Protection of our cultural heritage in the form of Ganga and Yamuna is vital. I would do my best to ensure clean Yamuna," she said.

"Nobody can move in the land of Krishna without blessing of Radha Rani. I don't have any self interest since Krishna has given me a lot. I want to serve Brij Bhumi and develop it as per aspiration of people and pilgrims," she said.

Asked about her availability after elections, she said, "Since I own a house in Mumbai, I would certainly go there. However, I shall give maximum time to residents of this area after election."

"The change in Mathura would be visible after a year," the cinestar asserted.

The promotion of spiritual tourism would be her another focus area. "Efforts would be made to connect Mathura with other pilgrim centres and places of tourist interest by air," Hema added.
