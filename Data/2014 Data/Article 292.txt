Bharatiya Janata Party to oppose genetically modified crops in its party manifesto

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party is likely to express its opposition to genetically modified (GM) crops in its party manifesto and suggest that an integrated commission be formed to look into all aspects of farming including minimum support price for grains, crop insurance, adequate and timely compensation to affected farmers and irrigation.

BJP Manifesto Committee Chief Murli Manohar Joshi met around 55 people, including farmers, scientists and NGOs representatives on Sunday to discuss various issues related to farmers.

The representatives also emphasised that the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance should set up an integrated commission if it comes to power to deal with all issues related to farmers. “The commission would ensure that farmers are given the right MSP (minimum support price) for their crops, decide the bonus, ensure that proper and timely compensation is given for damaged crops, and crop insurance,” Joshi said.
