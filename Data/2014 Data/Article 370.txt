Lok Sabha polls 2014: CPI-M rakes up 2G scam as a poll issue

NEW DELHI: Raking up 2G spectrum scam as a poll issue, CPI-M leader Sitaram Yechury today said it would be "very interesting" to find out how much space would be needed to keep Rs 1,76,000 crore in thousand-rupee notes.

"If you have a software, try and picture the amount of space that Rs 1,76,000 crore in thousand-rupee notes will require. As a side exercise, I suggest to you, when you go to your office, you do this. You will come across very interesting results," Yechury said here in a lighter vein.

Rs 1.76 lakh crore was the presumed loss to public exchequer in the 2G scam.

"This dimension of corruption you are seeing is directly connected with the sort of policies you have seen both Congress and BJP pursuing," he told reporters, maintaining that their reversal was the only way to end the massive graft.

In another witty repartee, Yechury said his party should be given Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) in Indian politics for experimenting the concept of supporting a government from outside.

"...one thing you must remember...we are against IPR. But if there is any Intellectual Property Rights in Indian politics, you must give the CPI-M the right of this concept of outside support," Yechury said smilingly.

He was asked why CPI-M was reluctant to be part of a coalition government at the national level.

Yechury, however, said the party's Central Committee would take a decision on this issue after the elections.
