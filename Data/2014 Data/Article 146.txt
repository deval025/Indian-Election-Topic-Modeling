AAP to launch campaign for LS polls from Kanpur in UP

KANPUR: Following the footsteps of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, AAP Chief Arvind Kejriwal will kick start his Lok Sabha poll campaign in Uttar Pradesh from Kanpur.

"Kejriwal will start his Lok Sabha election campaign from Kanpur on March 2. Party workers have received information regarding that from AAP's Sanjay Singh," said AAP member Omendra Bharat.

"The fact that many politicians choose Kanpur as the starting point for their election campaign, proves the significance the place holds in the political history of Uttar Pradesh," said Union Minister Sriprakash Jaiswal.

"Kanpur is Uttar Pradesh's commercial capital and people here are educated, that is why AAP has chosen it as the starting point," said Bharat.

While Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had started his Lok Sabha poll campaign from Kanpur in 2004, BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate also started the party's general election campaign from here.

"The party workers are excited and busy in preparations for the campaign" said Aseem Triwedi, famous cartoonist and AAP member.
