Leaders have no control over their parliamentarians: V Narayanasamy

NEW DELHI: "Leaders of political parties have no control over their parliamentarians," Union Minister V Narayanasamy said today hours after his own party MPs led the disruptions in the Lok Sabha over Telangana.

"By coming to the Well of the House, shouting slogans, not allowing the House to function, and the leaders of the political parties have no control over their MPs. It is unfortunate," Narayanasamy told reporters outside Parliament House.

When pointed out that his party MPs were also part of the groups protesting in the well of the House on Telangana issue, Narayanasamy said, "I am talking in general terms".

He said Parliament is the forum to discuss any issue concerning the people of the country.

"There is a rule, they can give notice... anything they can raise in the House," he said hours after both the Houses saw noisy scenes on the issue of Telangana.

MPs from Telangana as well as Seemandhra regions -- cutting across party lines -- stormed the Well.Those protesting included members from ruling Congress.

He lamented that two anti-corruption measures--Right to Citizens for Time Bound Delivery of Goods and Services and Redressal of Their Grievances Bill and Prevention of Bribery of Foreign Public Officials and Officials of Public International Organisations Bill--were listed in the Lower House today for passage but could not taken up as the MPs disrupted the proceedings.

"These kind of important legislations, which are the anti-corruption initiative, which have been the policy of the our government that the anti-corruption initiative has to be taken up.

"These bills have been stalled in Parliament. And ultimately the opposition after stalling the bill, they are blaming us that you are not allowing the House to function. Unfortunately it is there," he said.
