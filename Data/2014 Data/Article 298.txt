AAP lumpenising Indian politics: Congress

NEW DELHI: Attacking former Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Congress today accused his Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for lumpenising Indian politics.

"First they (AAP) try for cheap publicity. They indulge in anarchism and what now we saw in Mumbai the other day is the lumpenisation of Indian politics," senior Congress leader Anand Sharma told reporters here.

He was replying to a question about Kejriwal's controversial allegation that the whole media is "sold" and "heavy amounts" have been paid to promote BJP's prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi. < ..

The media should exercise self-restraint, Sharma said, adding they should not fall into AAP's trap, which try to "hog limelight" by doing something unusual.

"Kejriwal's comment was not good," Sharma said, adding that media have a viewpoint of its own on issues and media should be allowed to regulate themselves.

Further on the AAP leader Yogendra Yadav's comment that Modi is a threat and wants to divide the country, the commerce minister said, "AAP and BJP are in competition for anarchism, tension and fight. The thinking of Congress is different from both the parties."
