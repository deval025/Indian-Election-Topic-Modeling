Student community should set up own enterprises in India: Narendra Modi

CHENNAI: Batting for home grown corporates, BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi today exhorted the student community to set up their own enterprises in India in line with global giants like Apple, Microsoft and Google.

"Do whatever you can to make India innovative and to be competitive. Recently, Sathya Nadella became CEO of Microsoft. Most of you must be dreaming to reach the heights of Nadella", he said in his address at the ninth Convocation of SRM University near here.

"My advice to you is create a similar enterprise here. Create Microsoft here. Create an Apple. Create a Google here in India. And then own it and manage it", he said.

He said India has 65 per cent people below the age of 35 years. "It is most unfortunate that even after 65 years of independence, we have not focused on education. As a nation we should focus not only on individual progress or economic progress, but also nation building", he said.
