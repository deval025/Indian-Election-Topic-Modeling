WhatsApp to be the gamechanger in upcoming Lok Sabha polls

This Lok Sabha election will be fought on the ground and the internet. But while everyone recognizes the role of social media sites like Facebook and Twitter in the unfolding political drama, it's the mobile messaging service WhatsApp which might be the real game changer.

Politicians gearing up for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls have realized the potential of the application which can be used both for private and group messaging. Sources say that rather than the top brass, it is the local cadres who reported its effectiveness as a tool to connect with voters.

WhatsApp allows for micro-level, completely enclosed chat groups where a politician can send private messages to both party cadre as well potential voters for free. Similarly, constituencies are divided into several groups depending on socio-economic factors and a politician can hold separate private conversations with them on WhatsApp.

Unlike social networking websites which need internet profiles, WhatsApp operates in relative web oblivion. The application does use the internet but no search engine would be able to detect WhatsApp profiles, groups or chats. Real-time response also makes WhatsApp the most effective social networking tool for political campaigning.

Politicians in Odisha, Delhi and Rajasthan are already using WhatsApp to soft launch their campaigns. Their cadres are sending out invites to ensure massive turnouts at rallies and even using the platform to poke fun at rivals. Some MPs TOI spoke with say that WhatsApp allows them a quick understanding of the voter sentiment in an area.

The reason why WhatsApp trounces social networking sites is that it is much easier to use. An MP, representing a rural constituency, who didn't wish to be named, says all you need to know is how to message. "You don't need a social media profile or a log-on to access the message," he says.

The device can also be installed on tablets that do not have a SIM card or calling facility. This is a facility that a politician can make use of and the tablet could be managed by somebody else. As the message will carry the politician's real phone number it would seem like a personal communication.

WhatsApp reveals that it has more than 4 crore active users — those who use it at least once a month — per month in India. This number is big enough to affect voter behaviour. According to the Internet and Mobile Association of India, an organization which tracks the country's digital industry, the number of mobile internet users is going to reach 15.5 crore in March this year. WhatsApp, perhaps, is the easiest and most effective tool to reach most of them.

Another MP, who also requests anonymity, says that popular social networking sites also become a platform for people to vent their ire which may be disastrous at the time of elections. "It can become a complaint board with everyone having an open access," he says.

But politicians are also wary of the potency of medium and the damage it could cause. There have been news reports suggesting that WhatsApp was used to circulate a video that triggered the Muzaffarnagar riots.
