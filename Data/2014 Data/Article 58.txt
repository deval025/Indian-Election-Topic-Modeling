Gujarat BJP on overdrive for maximum seats

AHMEDABAD: All cosmetics apart, BJP in Gujarat is getting down to the basics to maximize its seats from the state in the Lok Sabha polls. Gujarat holds special significance for the party as the chief minister of the state is the prime ministerial candidate of BJP.

As a matter of fact, BJP in Gujarat has appointed Page Presidents, basing on electoral roles. Explaining the concept, Harshad Patel, Gujarat BJP Media Cell Convener said for each page of voterâ€™s list in a constituency a party worker is being assigned responsibility. "The experiment has been very successful in MP and now the party is launching this across the country," Patel said.

This will also help in maximum voter turn out, Patel maintained.

"The party workers at every level have been working very hard to reach out to the electorate," Om Mathur, BJP Gujarat in-charge had told this reporter earlier.

For Every Constituency a senior leader has been made responsible and Mathur himself is visiting all the 26 constituencies along with the state president and the constituency in-charge. "We had started meetings on strategy about six months ago and the series of meetings are being held to review the situation periodically," Mathur had said.

While BJP has 17 MPs out of 26 LS seats in Gujarat, a BJP source said the tally was more than likely to exceed 22 in the forthcoming election.
