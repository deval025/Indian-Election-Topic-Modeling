"Clear cut Modi wave", BJP will win more than 300 seats: Venkaiah Naidu

BANGALORE: Asserting that there was a "clear cut Modi wave", senior BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu today said the BJP will win more than 300 seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls as it has gained the confidence of the minorities and oppressed castes.

"There is a clear-cut Narendra Modi wave across the country. BJP will win more than 300 Lok Sabha seats. There is a tacit change among voters. Dalits, SC/STs and minorities have voted for the party in the state assembly elections last year," he said addressing BJP workers here.

Citing an example, Naidu said out of the 34 seats reserved for Scheduled Castes in Rajasthan, BJP won 20-odd assembly seats, clearly showing Dalit swing towards the party.

"Congress gave ten tickets to Muslim candidates in Rajasthan, but none of them could win a single seat. Whereas, BJP fielded four Muslim candidates and two won. This also shows the minority voters have voted for BJP," he said.

This trend was also seen in Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh and Delhi elections, Naidu added.

Speaking about the emergence of Third Front, Naidu said history showed the futility of such an alternative where there were far too many prime ministerial aspirants. "This is also seen even now. Deve Gowda, Nitish Kumar, Mamta Banerjee, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Jayalalitha, all want to be prime minister," he said.

Third Front is a non-existent alternative as some parties do not cherish proximity to other parties, Naidu said.

"RJD does not cherish proximity to JD(U); Trinamool Congress to Congress and Communists; SP to BSP; AIADMK to DMK, and hence where is the Third Front?" he questioned.

Naidu also ridiculed the Congress, and Third Front by saying their policies will push India backward and make its position awkward, respectively. "BJP means forward (progress), Congress means backward and Third Front awkward," he said.
