Treat Trinamool Congress as enemy number one, West Bengal Congress tells Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: The Trinamool Congress leadership announcing her party candidates for all the Lok Sabha constituencies in West Bengal on Wednesday came, incidentally, just two days after a delegation of top Congress leaders of the state told Rahul Gandhi in Delhi that they should treat Mamata Banerjee-led party as their rival number one in this elections.

The perennially faction-ridded state Congress delegation also showed an unusually overwhelming unanimity in telling Gandhi that the Congress must also treat Mamata’s party as a “under-cover ally of the Narendra Modi-led BJP waiting to move over to the NDA side post-poll”.

The meeting of the West Bengal Congress leaders with Gandhi on Monday was attended by AICC General Secretary incharge of the state C P Joshi, senior state Congress leaders such as state PCC chief and union minister Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, his predecessor, Pradip Bhattacharya, union minister Deepa Dasmunsi, CLP leader Manas Ranjan Bhunia.

When AICC leaders asked the state delegation whether they should respond to some feelers from Trinamool Congress for a possible alliance talks, the state leaders unanimously told them that state party had only suffered for aligning with the Trinamool Congress during the last Lok Sabha and state Assembly polls and therefore should fight on its own this time. These leaders listed before Gandhi and Joshi a series of instances, which according to them, was clear cases of Mamata’s party deliberately undercutting the interest of the state Congress despite both being allies that time.

An alliance with TMC will only suit Mamata and will boost her tally. And after the polls, Mamata Banerjee would switch over to the NDA side if she could help Modi-led BJP form the Government, they argued. The delegation also told Gandhi and Joshi that TMC was exploring a pre-poll alliance with the Congress only to re-assure the support of nearly 30% Muslim population in West Bengal which is wary of the projection of Modi as BJP prime ministerial candidature and is still conscious of the fact that Mamata Banerjee remained a minister in the NDA regime even after the Gujarat riots.
