Andhra Pradesh Assembly to meet for vote-on-account amid political tension

HYDERABAD: Andhra Pradesh Assembly will meet from tomorrow for presentation of vote-on-account budget for 2014-15, coinciding with the ongoing Parliament session in which the Telangana bill would be introduced this week.

The Assembly session would begin at 10 AM tomorrow, preceded by a special meeting of the state council of ministers to approve the budget.

The week ahead holds immense significance for Andhra Pradesh as its fate is likely to be decided in the Parliament.

The ruling Congress MPs from Seemandhra, who are at the receiving end of the people's anger over the proposed division of AP, said they would continue their efforts to keep the state united.

Congress MP Sabbam Hari claimed today that around 70 MPs support the no-confidence motion against the UPA government.

State BJP chief G Kishan Reddy said here yesterday that his party continues to be in favour of creation of Telangana but would seek some amendments to the bifurcation bill.

Meanwhile, speculation is rife as to whether Chief Minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy would continue in office or resign in protest against the bill.

Reddy, a staunch supporter of united Andhra Pradesh, staged an unprecedented sit-in at Jantar Mantar in Delhi recently to voice opposition to the state's division.
