BJP's dream is to eradicate poverty by 75th year of Indian independence: Narendra Modi

ASSAM: BJP's dream is to eradicate poverty and ensure better quality of life by the time India celebrates 75 years of independence, the party's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi said today.

"By the time one reaches 75 years, it is the stage of 'amrit parva'. We have a dream of celebrating India's amrit parva by improving the quality of life of the poor," Modi said during an election rally here. "Is this the life the freedom fighters had dreamt for us? Did martyrs like Bhagat Singh or Rajguru embrace death for the conditions prevailing now? Why did Mahatma Gandhi and Sardar Patel go to jail? .... Definitely not for corruption and denial of basic amenities and rights to the poor," he said.

BJP wants to form the government at Delhi to ensure that the poorest of the poor receives proper housing with water, power, toilet, schools and hospitals, Modi added.

"This is our dream. Give us the blessings to wipe the tears of the poor, dalit, scheduled caste and backward classes so that by 75 years of Independence, India will be a happy place," he said.

Stating that Assam was rich in water resources, he alleged, "You should be getting water throughout the year, but farmers do not get adequate water to irrigate their fields and neither does people get sufficient drinking water." Floods, on the other hand, was a major problem faced by the state with people suffering immense hardships but the Congress is not interested in solving these problems, he said.

"Where was the Chief Minister (Nabam Tuki) when the state faced devastating floods a few years ago? He was abroad and least concerned about the sufferings of the people in his state. There is no need to tolerate such a government," he said.
