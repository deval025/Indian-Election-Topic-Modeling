Amid talk of non-Congress, non-BJP alliance Mulayam Singh Yadav lauds Nitish Kumar

NEW DELHI: Amid efforts by various regional parties to firm up a non-Congress, non-BJP alliance ahead of Lok Sabha elections, SP chief Mulayam Singh Yadav today said Nitish Kumar was the only Railway Minister who made efforts to improve railway infrastructure in his Mainpuri constituency.

"My charge is that you are ignoring Mainpuri as I represent it (in Lok Sabha)...In the last Railway Budget I was assured that a train would run in Mainpuri. Nothing happened. (Ram Vilas) Paswan ji had assured some support. But it was Nitish Kumar (now Bihar Chief Minister) who took the project further," Yadav said in Lok Sabha.

He said if Mainpuri is connected to the Gwalior route which goes to Mumbai, it will benefit the people of the area.

He said even if his demand was not met, it will not affect the voters of his constituency though it will help the people.

Speaker Meira Kumar had given him a chance to speak on the Interim Rail Budget after it was passed without discussion.
