Vaiko meets Narendra Modi

CHENNAI: MDMK founder Vaiko, whose party has announced a tie-up with BJP for Lok Sabha elections, met the party's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi at a hotel here.

Modi and Vaiko discussed the former's rally, where the Gujarat Chief Minister had torn into Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram for questioning his knowledge of economics, a party statement said quoting the meeting which was held last night.

Vaiko told Modi that BJP alone would win around 250-272 Lok Sabha seats, it said, adding the MDMK leader also sought for Modi's dates to lead a farmers' convention in Erode district, which was being coordinated by his party's Lok Sabha MP A Ganeshamurthi.

While Vaiko did not participate in the Vandalur public rally here last evening addressed by Modi, he had sent senior leader Mallai Sathya on his behalf.
