Kejriwal has diverted from real issues: ATS chief

NEW DELHI: All-India Anti-Terrorist Front chief MS Bitta today hit out at AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal over the latter's support for the clemency plea of convicted terrorist Devinderpal Singh Bhullar, who is facing capital punishment.

"Kejriwal is now no longer focusing on corruption. He has diverted from the real issues. On one hand, he wears a Gandhi cap like (Anna) Hazare and (Lal Bahadur) Shastri, but on the other, he seeks clemency from the President (for Bhullar)," Bitta told reporters at the screening of the film, 'Jai Jawaan-Jai Kissan', at the FICCI auditorium here.

Bhullar was awarded the death penalty for triggering a bomb blast in New Delhi in September, 1993, in which nine persons were killed and 25 others injured, including Bitta, who was the then Youth Congress president.

He further alleged that despite having been the then CM, Kejriwal clashed with an SHO and had sought to have him removed.

Talking about the film, which is the based on the life of former Prime Minister Shastri, Bitta said, "State governments should give this film tax exemptions. If they don't do that, I would think that... governments are trying to hide the history of Shastri ji."

Former IPS officer Kiran Bedi and Lal Bahadur Shastri's son, Sunil Shastri, also attended the screening. The film by director Milan Ajmera will release in June across the county. At the programme, martyr Ved Prakash's wife was also felicitated with a bravery award by Bitta and Kiran Bedi. Wing Commander Anil Chopra, CRPF constable Naresh, Chander Mohan Saini, a farmer, and a team of CISF personnel were also given bravery awards.
