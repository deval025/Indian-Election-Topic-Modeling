Rahul Gandhi not in favour of tickets for politicians' kin

DIPHU: Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi today said that he was not in favour of family members of politicians getting party tickets to contest polls.

"I am not in favour of giving tickets to family members of Congress leaders and want to change this trend," Gandhi said during an interaction with representatives of nine Autonomous Councils at the Karbi Anglong Sports Association stadium here.

People should elect their own representatives, he said, adding he had already started the process in this direction.

"I want people to be a part of the process of selecting candidates and want the public to select their own candidates," he said.

Gandhi has initiated an experiment of choosing Congress candidates for Lok Sabha polls through the "primary" system wherein a political party or a political alliance nominates candidates for an election by short-listing them through an internal vote.

Guwahati constituency is among the 16 constituencies selected as a part of this experiment for the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.
