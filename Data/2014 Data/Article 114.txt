Arvind Kejriwal's act against gas price issue is an 'attack on federalism': Arun Jaitley

NEW DELHI: BJP leader Arun Jaitley has said the Delhi government has exceeded its rights by taking on the Centre over the issue of gas pricing and lodging FIRs against petroleum minister Moily, his predecessor Murli Deora, law minister Kapil Sibal and Reliance Industries chief Mukesh Ambani.

Terming the action as an attack on federalism, Jaitley, the leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha, said in an article posted on his website on Wednesday that the merits of the gas pricing issue notwithstanding, the Delhi government had no jurisdiction over the matter. "Ordinarily, when we perceive threats to federalism, it is suspected that encroachment of federal principles is by the Centre. The Centre, through its agencies, cannot usually investigate what happens in the states. It is only in extreme cases that it issues an advisory or, where there is breakdown of constitutional machinery, it can invoke powers under Articles 356," he wrote.

"What happened in Delhi yesterday, therefore, merits a comment," he added. "Delhi is a Union Territory with a state assembly.

Legislative and executive jurisdiction of Delhi is circumscribed by Article 239AA. Entries 1, 2 and 18 of the State List under the Seventh Schedule are not applicable to Delhi. Entry 1 deals with public order, entry 2 with police and entry 18 with land. Thus powers to regulate public order and police are currently not with the Legislative Assembly. The Delhi government has, therefore, no police powers. What thus is the function of the anti-corruption branch of the Delhi government? The anti-corruption branch is part of the vigilance directorate of the Delhi government. In pith and substance, it is the function related to vigilance and not to the police powers," he said.

Compliance with the letter and spirit of the Constitution requires restraint and statesmanship, he said.
