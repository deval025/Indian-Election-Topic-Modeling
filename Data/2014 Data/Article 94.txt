Congress solely responsible for fracas in Parliament: Arun Jaitley

NEW DELHI: Holding Congress "solely responsible" for today's fracas in Parliament, BJP leader Arun Jaitley today said the incident has given a bad name to Indian democracy as the Congress leadership has lost control over its members and it could have been avoided.

Terming the events as a "theatre of the absurd", the Leader of the Opposition in Rajya Sabha said it could have been avoided had the Congress leadership done adequate home work and were able to control the members.

"What has happened in Parliament has brought a bad name to Indian democracy....The Congress alone is responsibile for bringing a bad name to Indian democracy," he said.

Training his guns on the Congress leadership, Jaitley said as it has lost control over its members, they are out to create unpleasant scenes in the House. "The worst of what has happened today is by Congress members," he said.

He said the incident in Lok Sabha is a "serious blow" to India's parliamentary democracy as dangerous and prohibited devices were used to block the proceedings.

Jaitley said the present crisis is directly on account of UPA's failure on the issue of creation of Telangana while simultaneously addressing legitimate concerns of people there.

"It is Congress and Congress alone which must take the responsibility for completely mishandling the situation. Today's theatre of the absurd could have been avoided only if the Congress leadership had done adequate home work and was able to control its own members," he said.

The BJP leader also cited the smooth creation of Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Uttarakhand during the NDA regime when concerns of all regions were addressed and there were no protests.
