Sushma Swaraj praises Sonia Gandhi in Lok Sabha

NEW DELHI: Putting behind the acrimony witnessed during the session, Leader of the Opposition Sushma Swaraj today praised Sonia Gandhi and other Congress leaders, returning the accolades received in the Lok Sabha.

Swaraj, who had once said that she will tonsure her head if Sonia Gandhi becomes Prime Minister, today said she was a graceful leader.

As she spoke for the last time in the 15th Lok Sabha, which was today adjourned sine die, Swaraj showered praise on BJP patriarch L K Advani who was seen with moist eyes.

Swaraj, who was at her witty best, drew applause from members as she mentioned that Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kamal Nath tried "shararat (mischief)" ways, while Leader of the House Sushilkumar Shinde displayed "sharafat (decency)".

Besides, she said UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi's gracefulness and the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's gentleness helped in conduct of the 15th Lok Sabha.

While Swaraj appreciated the "nayay priyata (judicious)" approach of Advani, the BJP patriarch was seen with moist eyes and trying hard to control his tears.

"We are going back with so many sweet and sour memories," Swaraj said.
When the history of the 15th Lok Sabha is written, it will say that for most of the time there were interruptions but most awaited bills were also passed during this time, she noted.

She mentioned that many important bills including those related to Telangana, street vendors and land acquisition were passed in the 15th Lok Sabha.

"We oppose each other but we are not enemies... We oppose ideologies," she said.

Swaraj also said that she cannot bless them victory but can wish them glory. "We should contest (elections) with dignity," she added.
