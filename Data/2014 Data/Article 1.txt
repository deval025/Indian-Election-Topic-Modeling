Omar Abdullah refutes breakup talks in National Conference-Congress alliance

The Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister was responding to queries on media speculation on the ruling alliance split over the issue of creation of new administrative units in the state which the Congress had been stonewalling.

Commenting on NC supremo Farooq Abdullah's meeting with DMK President M Karunanidhi, Omar said that the two dignitaries are friends and their meeting should not be seen as a political meeting.

But he hinted that the meet may have been to strengthen ties between Congress and DMK.
"Karunanidhi is an old friend of Farooq. They have worked with each other at times. There is no need to convert personal relations into political relations," he said.

"There was a hue and cry over the issue of Farooq meeting Karunanidhi and it was being projected that NC is leaving UPA. We have no decision to leave the UPA. The friendship with whom we have, will continue, and political relations will continue as well," he said.

"Maybe it is possible that Karunanidhi will again join UPA and make the alliance powerful," he said.

Replying to a question on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's plans to field AAP candidates against Farooq Abdullah, he said, "If Arvind Kejriwal wants to field any candidate from Srinagar, let him do it. We will send him back after he forfeits its deposits in the elections."
