Mamata Banerjee should be more critical of Narendra Modi: Maulana Barkati

KOLKATA: Accusing BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi of being an "opportunist", prominent city cleric Maulana Barkati today asked Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjee to be more critical of Modi in order to prove her secular credentials.

The Imam of city's Tipu Sultan Mosque, Maulana Barkati, told a news agency, "We know she is secular but If Mamata Banerjee wants to prove her secular credentials, she should be more aggressive and critical about Modi. Rahul Gandhi has been critical of Modi, we want Mamata Banerjee also to come out openly in criticising Modi."

The cleric's comment comes at a time when all political parties are aggressively trying to woo Muslims for their 28 per cent minority votes, which is a deciding factor for 28-30 seats of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state.

Barkati lashed out at Modi for seeking the votes of the Muslim community.

"Why is he asking for the votes of Muslims, when he has a problem in wearing the Muslim cap. He should be ashamed about asking for our votes. He is an opportunist," he charged.
