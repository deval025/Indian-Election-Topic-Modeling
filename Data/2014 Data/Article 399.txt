Narendra Modi slams Congress for encouraging 'vote-bank politics' leading to influx that is destroying Assam

GOGAMUKH: BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi today alleged that Congress' vote-bank politics was encouraging illegal migration from Bangladesh which was in turn destroying Assam.

"Influx of illegal migrants from Bangladesh has threatened the identity of Assam, its future and the very existence of its people. Vote-bank politics has destroyed Assam and we cannot allow it," Modi said during a campaign rally here."I am surprised that Bangladeshis have been given the right to vote, but legitimate Indians in many cases have been denied their basic rights," Modi alleged.

He also alleged that the aim of the Congress was to finish Assam and its people and save Bangladeshis. "It is a conspiracy to invite Bangladeshis to settle down in Assam for their selfish ends. We will give legitimate people their due right and nobody can stop us," he said.

Speaking about Hindu migrants from Bangladesh, he said that they should be sheltered in India, but Assam should not bear their brunt alone.

"Hindus from Bangladesh have suffered immense hardship and forced to flee from there. They are refugees. Where will they go? It is our duty to give them shelter in India."Hindu refugees from Bangladesh are victims of politics and we must ensure their security and dignity, but Assam should not bear the burden alone," he said.

The entire country, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and others must share the burden, he said. In Kashmir also, the situation was same where lakhs of Hindus were in camps and the UPA government "had not given them right to citizenship", he alleged.

"It is the need of the hour to stop influx and we take this as our responsibility. After May 16, Hum chun chun ke hisab lenge (we will settle each and every account)," Modi added.
