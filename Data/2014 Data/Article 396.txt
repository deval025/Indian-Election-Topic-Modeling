Lok Sabha polls: Congress not interested in bringing back black money, says Narendra Modi

SIVASAGAR: BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi today alleged that Congress was not interested in bringing back black money stashed in foreign banks as 'it belonged to them'.

"Why is Congress opposing the move to bring back the money? Because it belongs to them. They have been opposing it for the last ten years and they have no intention of bringing it back," Modi said during an election rally here.

"Everyone in the country has been urging the Congress government to bring back black money to India, but they are not taking any initiative though they have promised so in their manifesto," he said.

"Now, in their 2014 manifesto they have mentioned that they will bring back the black money. They have been in power for the last ten years. What stopped them from bringing the money back till now?" he asked.

Alleging that the manifesto was a 'cheat document', he said, "It is the money of the poor that has been snatched. Don't you think that black money should be brought back?"

Claiming that the Congress had crossed all limits in corruption, atrocities and bad governance, Modi said, "Even Rajiv Gandhi had said that if Re 1 is released from Delhi, it becomes 15 paise once it reaches the village level."

Alleging that the party had no leader, policy or any intention to work for the country, he said, "It is time to bid farewell to Manmohan Singh, but still I want to ask him, he was elected from Assam, and what did he do for the North East?

"You did nothing and you have no concern for the region," Modi said.
