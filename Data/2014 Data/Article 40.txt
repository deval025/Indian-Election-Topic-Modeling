Third Front attempts a 'futile' exercise: Ravi Shankar Prasad, BJP

NEW DELHI: BJP today dubbed the attempts of regional parties and the Left to forge a Third Front as a "futile exercise" carried out before every election and compared it with rituals associated with a marriage.

he party also termed it as an exercise attempted by "tired" people who have "lost" faith of the people.

"Rituals are an integral part of any marriage. A futile exercise of Third Front or a Federal Front is integral to every election," BJP's deputy leader in Rajya Sabha Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

He said the thought of a Third Front "is a part of history as it has no relevance for the present and no promise for the future".

Prasad said earlier there used to be such attempts being made at one place, now such attempts are being made across the country, including one in the South and one in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

He referred to the alliance forged between AIADMK and CPI and CPI(M) in Tamil Nadu as well as "failed" attempts made by SP leader Mulayam Singh Yadav in Uttar Pradesh and Nitish Kumar in Bihar.

Rubbishing such attempts, the BJP leader said no one knows who their leader will be or what their policies are.

"This is an initiative by tired people who have lost faith of the people of the country. Still, every one has the right to make such attempts in a democracy," he said.

In indications of emergence of a Third Front ahead of Lok Sabha polls, 11 non-Congress and non-BJP parties today joined hands as a block in Parliament to pitch for pro-people, anti-communal and federal agenda.

The announcement was made at a joint press conference of leaders of these parties including the four Left parties, Samajwadi Party, JD(U), AIADMK, AGP, Jharkhand Vikas Morcha, JD(S) and BJD.
