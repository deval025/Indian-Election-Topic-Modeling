"Let us see," says Arvind Kejriwal on contesting LS poll against Narendra Modi
BECHARAJI (GUJARAT): AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal today did not rule out his election face-off with BJP's prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi, saying "let us see."
Replying to a question if he will contest against Modi, Kejriwal said, "Let us see," and added that to fight an election or not to fight it is not the main issue.

His party has earlier said that Kejriwal may contest elections against Modi, if he stands from anywhere outside Gujarat.
There are speculations that Modi might fight elections from one seat in Uttar Pradesh and one in Gujarat. However, BJP has maintained that it has not decided on the issue yet.

In reply to a question on former Delhi Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit being made Governor of Kerala, Kejriwal alleged that it was an attempt to shield her from ongoing investigation where he, as the chief minister of Delhi, had filed an FIR against her for scam during Commonwealth Games.

Kejriwal also charged BJP with having double standard on the issue of dharna by Madhya Pradesh Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan.

"This is their double standard," he said on a question of BJP accusing him of being anarchist when as a chief minister he sat on dharna even as their CM Chouhan is planning to stage a sit-in with his entire Cabinet.

Chouhan had yesterday said that in view of the apathetic attitude of the Centre towards farmers, the entire Cabinet will stage a sit-in in Bhopal tomorrow during a day-long bandh call given by the BJP.

Kejriwal is on a four-day tour of Gujarat to verify development claims of the Modi government.
