Kiran Kumar Reddy awaits Congress move in AP; holds talks on new outfit

HYDERABAD :A week after resigning from his post and quitting Congress over the Andhra Pradesh bifurcation issue, caretaker Chief Minister N Kiran Kumar Reddy is yet to take a decisive step on launching a new party and continuing with the consultations on his next political move.

The cricketer-turned-politician, who vehemently opposed division of Andhra Pradesh, today continued his deliberations with expelled Congress MPs and other leaders on the possibility of launching a new outfit.

Reddy, who quit his post and also Congress on February 19, has been holding consultations with his supporters, including MPs, MLAs, MLCs and other party leaders since the last few days.

Lok Sabha member Sabbam Hari, who was one of the MPs expelled from Congress for moving a no-confidence motion against the UPA Government, felt that developments in Delhi (with regard to formation of new Government in AP) would influence Reddy's plans.

AICC General Secretary Digvijay Singh, in-charge of party affairs in AP, has been talking to Ministers, MLAs and other Congress leaders on the issue of forming a new Government. State Congress leaders have reportedly made a request in that regard to the party leadership.

"People (in Seemandhra) are feeling a sense of shame with the comments of some leaders that we will stay with that party (Congress). As far as this issue (Reddy) is concerned, steps will be taken once Delhi developments become clear," Hari said.
