Jat reservation: Irrational extension of patronage politics

Perpetuating the paradigm of patronage politics as an essential electoral tool couldn’t have been more clearer than the government, in what could possibly be the last Cabinet meeting of UPA-II, deciding to include the Jat community in the OBC list for reservations in jobs and education in nine states. The simple logic is that a numerically large community, across key states like Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, among others, has been given a sop good enough to ensure they vote for the Congress. Whether that strategy works, though, is moot, if only because this move will affect other OBCs as their share of the reservation pie will shrink.

On the whole, India’s reservation policy has become a sort of battleground where political parties cast the electorate as competing caste groups. In simple terms, this defines what India’s politics continues to mostly be: a process, or rather a playing off, of competitive identity management. In turn, these social groups actually then begin to strive and compete for evermore backwardness — in terms of classification, at least. Witness the numerous Jat and Gujjar agitations for lower status, with the Gujjar demand for inclusion in the ST category itself being a result of feeling left out due to the Meena community garnering a bigger share of the ST pie. It is, in other words, a race towards the bottom of the social pyramid.

The whole idea of progressive, affirmative action, also called positive discrimination in favour of dispossessed groups, in India has been totally subsumed by the system of political patronage. This, along with violent agitations, also means the polity being segregated along ever-sharpening caste lines in the scramble to grab a piece of that ever-shrinking pie.
