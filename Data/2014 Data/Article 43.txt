No riots in Gujarat in last 12 years, thanks to Narendra Modi: Rajnath Singh

KOLKATA: Terming that the 2002 Godhra riots was an unfortunate incident, BJP president Rajnath Singh today said it is the credit of Gujurat Chief Minister and BJP prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi that no such incident has taken place in the state in the last 12 years.

"Some divisive forces are active in Bengal to create disturbances in Bengal. Some people should go to Gujurat and see. Congress always talks about the riots in Gujurat. Yes, an unfortunate incident did happen there. A very unfortunate incident," Singh said while addressing a rally here. "But it is also the credit of Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi that no such incident or riots has ever taken place there in the last 12 years," he said with Modi sitting beside him.

Time and again, Congress has attacked Modi on the issue of Godhra riots in Gujarat in 2002. Modi took a dig at the UPA's "flawed" policies in dealing with the influx of Bangladeshi refugees in Bengal. "For the growth of the country, there should be development of the youth. The youth of India should first get jobs. But now the Bangladeshis are getting it. Where will the youth of our country go," said Modi.
