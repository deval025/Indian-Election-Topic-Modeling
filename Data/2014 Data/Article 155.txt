Yashwant Sinha’s son Jayant quits job, turns full-time BJP man

MUMBAI: Former Finance Minister and senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha’s son, Jayant Sinha, has quit investment firm Omidyar Network to work full-time for the saffron party. He will help the BJP frame economic policies while also helping his father in the upcoming elections.

“There is tremendous amount of work to be done on the policy side, I have been helping BJP on issues like jump-starting growth and creating jobs,” Jayant told ET. “I will also be helping my father in the upcoming polls. This is going to be his sixth Lok Sabha election,” he added. On entering election fray, Jayant said he has kept all his options open.

Jayant’s entry into BJP comes at a time when the party seems to be scouting for professionals to help it chart its economic agenda if it comes to power.

On February 11th , ET had reported that BJP is roping in noted economists Arvind Panagariya of Columbia University to help it draft its economic agenda.

In an interaction with ET, Piyush Goyal, BJP treasurer and a top member of the party’s economic agenda team, had said they are soliciting ideas from top economists on crucial issues like land acquisitions and monetary policy. On BJP spelling out its economic agenda, Sinha said there is a major event planned for February 27th in Delhi, where he thinks it will be good time for Modi to lay out the economic policy of the party.

“Modi has been speaking about economic road map at various events. In BJP, there are experienced people working on it,” he added. Sinha who holds an engineering degree from Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi and a management degree from Harvard Business school joined Omidyar in 2009 to run the India operations.

Sinha says since the firm entered India, it has made some successful investments in both for profit and non-profit organisations by ploughing $120 m capital in the country.
