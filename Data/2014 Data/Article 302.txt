Congress going through generational,structural change: Digvijay Singh

HYDERABAD: Observing that the Congress is going through a "generational and structural change", AICC General Secretary Digvijay Singh said here today that leaders like him want young leaders to emerge in the party.

"I don't think anyone of the senior (Congress) political leaders are talking of 'sanyas' any more. But yes, the Congress party is going through a structural and generational change and we would like the new leadership to emerge and new people to take charge. Therefore, some people may have said they would rather allow younger people to contest elections," he said.

He was replying to a query about senior Congress leaders announcing their decision not to contest elections.

Answering a question if he is considered Rahul Gandhi's "mentor", he said, "It is absolutely wrong information that you have. I am neither his mentor nor his guru. He does not need either. He is a man with his own convictions, own ideas and own mind. He has the courage of conviction to carry out what he wants to do," he said.
