Lok Sabha polls 2014: Congress assures solution to drug menace in Goa

PANAJI: The Congress party in Goa has promised to offer a solution to the vexed drug mafia issue in its election manifesto for the current Lok Sabha polls.

Goa Congress chief John Fernandes said the manifesto will have a few local issues which includes tackling the drug mafia existing along the state coast.

Interestingly, Congress' North Goa candidate Ravi Naik and his son Roy are indicted in the State Legislative Assembly's house committee report for allegedly sheltering Israeli drug lord Yaniv Benaim alias Atala.

Fernandes said a permanent mechanism needs to be worked out to end this continuing drug menace in the state.

The party has also listed special status, solution for crisis faced by people with dual nationality, besides law and order situation on the top of their manifesto.

Fernandes said Naik's indictment was discussed in the Central Election Committee (CEC) meeting which resolved that since there is no evidence against Naik, it does not disqualify him from contesting the polls.

BJP has already decided to encash on Naik's indictment in the House committee report in their poll campaign.

BJP Goa spokesman Dr Wilfred Mesquita said the best way to say 'No' to drugs is by not voting for Ravi Naik.

He said the BJP has given a clean candidate in Shripad Naik who will be accepted by the North Goa electorate.
