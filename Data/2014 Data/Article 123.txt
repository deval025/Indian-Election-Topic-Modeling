Aam Aadmi Party plans to collect Rs 2,014 per booth in MP

BHOPAL: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is likely to contest all 29 Lok Sabha seats in Madhya Pradesh where it has drawn up a plan to collect Rs 2,014 from each booth to mobilise funds for upcoming polls, a party leader said today.

"We will collect Rs 2,014 from each booth to generate funds for coming Lok Sabha elections", AAP candidate from Khandwa Parliamentary seat Alok Agrawal told reporters here.

The funds will be collected under the fledgling party's "Mission-2014". There were more than 50,000 booths during last year's assembly election in the state.

The party is organising a two-day programme from tomorrow to train its state-level volunteers in campaigning for the polls, he said.

To a question, Agrawal said in all probability AAP will contest from all the 29 Lok Sabha seats in the BJP-ruled state.

Agrawal, who is agitating for long for the rights of dam-affected people in the Narmada valley, promised that if AAP forms the government at the Centre it will ensure the compensation due to them gets distributed within six months.

He said he will ensure the compensation issue gets incorporated in AAP's manifesto.
