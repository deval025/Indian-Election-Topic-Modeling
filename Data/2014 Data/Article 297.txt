Governing tougher than organising rallies: Jairam Ramesh to AAP

SANGAREDDY: Taking a swipe at Aam Aadmi Party, Congress leader and Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh today said governing was much more difficult than organising rallies.

AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal failed to deliver when he was in power (as Delhi Chief Minister), and in fact chose to quit in just 49 days, Ramesh said, addressing a press conference here.

He said Congress had fulfilled its promise to carve out the state of Telangana, respecting the wishes of four crore people in the region.

BJP, on the other hand, adopted a double standard, Ramesh said.

It supported the Telangana bill in the Lok Sabha but tried to create hurdles in the Rajya Sabha, he alleged.
