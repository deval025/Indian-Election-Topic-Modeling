Narendra Modi's thinking not "futuristic": Amarinder Singh

NEW DELHI/CHANDIGARH: Congress' Lok Sabha candidate from Amritsar Amarinder Singh today criticised Narendra Modi's style of functioning, saying the thinking of BJP's Prime Ministerial nominee were not futuristic like Rahul Gandhi.

"Somebody may have been a successful Chief Minister. But the style of thinking is yesteryear," Singh said without naming Modi.

However, he claimed that Congress Vice President in contrast had a futuristic outlook. He said that Rahul Gandhi is the country's future and lauded the Nehru-Gandhi scion's "futuristic approach".

Singh, who is pitted against Arun Jaitley from the high profile Amritsar parliamentary constituency, today promised to give the senior BJP leader, who is fighting his maiden electoral battle, a tough fight.

"I am going to give it one hell of a fight," Singh told reporters in Chandigarh in an informal talk.

He said though Jaitley, a Rajya Sabha MP is a nice man, but he has not tested electoral battle before. BJP has fielded Jaitley this time in place of sitting MP Navjot Singh Sidhu.

Singh claimed that the people of Amritsar were very happy and he was very sure that they were going to "pull it off".

He said he felt privileged to contest from Amritsar with which he has deep spiritual and emotional attachment.

Moreover, he added, he knew Amritsar and its people very closely for about four decades.

"I bow my head to the sacred soil of this holy City and feel blessed that I have been provided a chance to represent and serve its people more closely in the highest temple of country's democracy, that is the parliament of India," he said, adding the people of Amritsar will continue to shower "love and affection" they have always given him.
