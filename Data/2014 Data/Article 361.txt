Congress candidate Ravi Naik's drug nexus becomes poll issue

PANAJI: Congress candidate Ravi Naik's indictment in the drug nexus has become an election issue with the opposition targeting him and allies defending him.

"Naik has been indicted by the House Committee. Even the Swedish model named him in the drug nexus and I am surprised that the Congress has weeding out of drugs as one of the main issues in its election manifesto," Goa Democratic Front (GDF) president Dayanand Narvekar said during a press conference here today.

Incidentally, Naik and his son Roy, were accused by Swedish model Lucky Farmhouse of having a nexus with drug peddlers. The Goa State assembly's house committee report had also indicted him for his role during his tenure as Goa's home minister.

Congress North Goa candidate Naik is contesting elections against BJP's Shripad Naik, GDF's Dayanand Narvekar and Aam Aadmi Party's Dattaram Desai.

Narvekar said neither the then Congress-led government nor the present BJP government is interested in doing away with the drug menace.

"The BJP has kept on hold the report of the House committee which has indicted Naik. Everything looks like match fixing," Narvekar said.

BJP which has been the main contestant against the Congress said that voters must say no to drugs by voting against the Congress party.

"The best slogan would be say no to drugs, by saying no to Ravi Naik and no to Congress," Goa's BJP spokesman Wilfred Mesquita said.

However, Congress has defended Naik's candidature claiming that he has not indicted by any court.
