Rahul Gandhi to join youth Congress `Vikas Khoj Yatra' in Gujarat

"Rahul Gandhi will join the Youth Congress yatra at Bardoli in Surat district and walk with the workers for five km," state Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said.

He will also address a rally at Bardoli, Doshi said. The yatra started from here on January 18 and will cover 500 km on in 23 days, passing through nine Lok Sabha constituencies.
The objective is to `verify development claims' of the Narendra Modi government.
