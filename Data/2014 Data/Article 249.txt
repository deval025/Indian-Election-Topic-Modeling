BJP's 'talks' to clinch poll deal for Tamil Nadu shifts to Delhi

CHENNAI: Barring a few glitches over contentious seats, BJP appeared to have sealed an alliance pact with DMDK and PMK for the Lok Sabha elections in Tamil Nadu and a final decision is expected this evening.
Senior leaders of BJP's Tamil Nadu unit left here for Delhi this afternoon to meet party President Rajnath Singh to get his stamp of approval for the deal, party sources said.

"You will know everything by this evening...we are meeting Rajnath Singh... we want to complete this exercise today itself," BJP national Executive member L Ganesan, a former state unit chief, told PTI.

State union President Pon Radhakrishnan and Ganesan among others are expected to meet Singh this evening.

BJP had been holding talks with the DMDK headed by actor-politician Vijaykanth and PMK for weeks and the marathon parleys faced glitches in respect of some constituencies like Mayiladuthurai and Krishnagiri, party sources said.

"The problem is with regard to only very few seats and this is being resolved," a BJP leader said declining to be named.

BJP has so far roped in the Vaiko-led MDMK and some fledgling parties, including IJK. MDMK is demanding that it be treated on a par with the PMK and the DMDK in seat allocation.
