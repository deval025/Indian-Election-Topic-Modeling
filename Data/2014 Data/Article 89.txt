Sushil Modi pitches for clear majority for BJP

NEW DELHI: Pitching for a clear majority for BJP in Lok Sabha elections, party leader Sushil Kumar Modi today said Narendra Modi will find it difficult to provide an effective government if it gets less than 200 seats.

Arguing that managing a coalition of too many parties will be a hindrance to good governance, the former Bihar Deputy Chief Minister said BJP must get at least 200 seats if it is to live up to the people's expectation.

He, however, fended off a query if Modi should refuse to become Prime Minister if BJP gets less than 200 seats, saying they are sure that they would get more than that.

"If you stop BJP at 180-190 seats, then Modi will not be able to provide a good government. He also thinks so. That's why we have launched 272-plus campaign. You can keep together two-four parties but managing 20-plus parties could be difficult," he said at an event organised by Aaj Tak.

He said BJP is in touch with many parties and some of them will come around to supporting it after elections.

Union Minister Manish Tewari contended it is not post-poll but pre-poll alliance which will count when the President will invite a coalition to form the government in case of a fractured mandate.

"The President will have to decide whose alliance is pre-poll and whose is post-poll. There has been a constitutional tradition about it. No party wants to touch BJP," he said.

Citing the big turn-outs at Modi's rallies as an indication of things to come, Sushil Kumar Modi said while BJP stalwart Atal Bihari Vajpayee could attract 50,000 to 1 lakh-strong audience Modi was drawing much bigger numbers across the country.

"It's one thing to draw crowds and another to convert them into votes," Tewari countered.

He also countered corruption charges against UPA government and said Vajpayee-led NDA dispensation also had serious corruption allegations against it.
