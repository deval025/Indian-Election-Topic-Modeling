Nitish Kumar hits poll campaign; raises special status issue

BAGHA: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar today attacked the Congress-led UPA government for denying special category status to the state under 'political pressure' and appealed people to provide 'strength' in the ensuing general elections and make Delhi hear them.

"Delhi takat ki sunti hai (Delhi hears only those who have strength)," he said during a 'Sankalp yatra' for the special category status to Bihar from Bagha in West Champaran district.

Kumar alleged that Congress and BJP teamed up to provide special category status and special package to Seemandhra but not to Bihar.

Confirming that Bihar's special status would be JD(U)'s be main poll plank in the Lok Sabha elections, the chief minister said he would continue the struggle for the special category status to spur development till it was realised.

In an apparent dig at rival RJD which is in the final process of forging tie-up with Congress for the elections, Kumar said under 'political pressure' the Centre put the special category agenda in 'cold storage'.

"There was every possibility to provide the status that will give tax benefits for setting up industries on the basis of the Raghuram Rajan committee report but in the last minute a brake was applied (under pressure of RJD) by calling off the Finance Secretary meeting on November 26 last year," he said.
