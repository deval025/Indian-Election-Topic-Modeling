Rahul Gandhi would like to settle in Arunachal 'after retirement'

HAPOLI (ARUNACHAL): Enchanted by natural beauty of Arunachal Pradesh, Congress Vice-President Rahul Gandhi today said he would like to settle there after "retirement".

Addressing a rally here in Lower Subansiri district, Gandhi said he would love to settle at Hapoli, popularly known as the Apatani plateau "after my retirement"

"I have never seen such a beautiful place anywhere in the country and am also willing to spend a few days here to enjoy the natural beauty," he said.

Gandhi also said that real development was possible only after devolution of power to panchayats and party-ruled Arunachal Pradesh had set an example in this regard.

"The literacy rate of the state has significantly improved in the past decade and the state government has launched several schemes for empowering youth and women," he said.

He also referred to programmes like Skill Development Council, Employment Generation Council and the Chief Minister's Livelihood Mission Schools.

Arunachal, he said in his brief 16-minute speech, had shown the country the path of peace and zealously protected its culture and history which should be emulated by all states of the country.

"The women of the Northeast are very strong as society empowers them. The people of the country should learn from the Northeast," he said at the rally ahead of the April nine Assembly and Lok Sabha elections.

Referring to the immense potential in tourism, horticulture and hydro-power sectors in the state, Gandhi said that more focus should be given on these sectors for overall development of the state as well as the entire country.
