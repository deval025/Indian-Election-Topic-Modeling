Ravishankar's apparent jibe at Arvind Kejriwal

VARANASI: In an apparent jibe at AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, The Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravishankar today said those who claim themselves as honest and the rest as dishonest should first introspect themselves.

"Those who say that they are honest and the rest are not honest should first introspect themselves," he told reporters here without taking Kejriwal's name.

On whether he considered Kejriwal as a good example for healthy politics and whether people like him should enter politics, Ravishankar said, "Woh abhi bacche hain (he is a child now)."
