Congress manifesto a document of 'deceit': BJP

NEW DELHI: BJP today dubbed the Congress manifesto as a "document of deceit" and a rank insult to the people of the country as the ruling party has made lofty promises at the time of departing and accused it of not fulfilling what it pledged during the past ten years.

"This is not a manifesto, but it is a document of deceit. It is a rank insult to the people of the country," BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

He also charged the Congress of "rubbing salt on the wounds of people" by promising them lofty dreams when it is time for their departure, after having failed to fulfil the promises made in the last 10 years.

"Their entire manifesto appears to be devoid of credibility, bereft of substance and seriously lacking in seriousness," the BJP leader said.

Prasad also attacked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Congress President Sonia Gandhi for leading the country to the path of declining economy and for not acting against corruption.

Taking a jibe at the Congress, he said while promising to light up every home, the actions of its government have rendered the whole city into darkness.

Attacking the Congress party over corruption issue, Prasad said the Adarsh scam and Ashok Chavan have become its "adarsh (role model)" and said, "it is not in the Congress grain to fight against corruption".

"The Congress leaders commit corruption with impunity and Congress leaders save them shamelessly," he said, claiming that the ruling party would not have acted on any scam had there not been opposition pressure, media scrutiny and intervention by the courts.

The BJP leader also accused the Congress government of "committing a fraud" on the country on the issue of poverty reduction as also on the promise to bring back blackmoney stashed abroad.
