Narendra Modi plays fast and loose with truth: Omar Abdullah

SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah today hit-out at Narendra Modi, saying the BJP Prime Ministerial candidate "plays fast and loose with the truth" and his rally in the state is being "blissfully ignored" by him.

"NaMo certainly plays fast & loose with the truth. He quotes me & can't even get that right. Modi Sb please quote me but do it right :-)," Omar wrote on Twitter.

Modi, in a rally in Jammu today, quoted Omar as having said that Jammu and Kashmir had never witnessed a rally as huge as Modi's on December 1 last year.

"When I came here for a rally last time, state Chief Minister (Omar) used a helicopter to see how huge the rally was. And he (Omar) was honest to say on Twitter that Jammu and Kashmir had never witnessed such a rally," Modi said in his speech at Hira Nagar today.

However, Omar denied the same. Omar had uploaded a photograph, taken from an aircraft, of Modi's December 1 rally last year at Jammu, to highlight the attendance of the people.

"Taken at 1:50 today while the state chopper was flying to Srinagar. Anyone want to estimate crowd size?" Omar had said in the December 1 tweet.

"I put the photograph because it's a small stadium with lots of open space visible. Estimates range from 25,000 to 45,000. You decide #Jammu," he wrote in another tweet.

The Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister also said he was "blissfully ignoring" Modi's today's rally in the state.

"@ManikGup92 sorry to disappoint you but I'm not. I'm actually blissfully ignoring it while sitting in Srinagar. Ignoring all but the lies :)," Omar wrote in a reply to a Twitter user when asked if he was watching the rally on television.

"And for those of you gloating that I'm watching the rally on TV sorry to disappoint you. Only know what he said because I was asked 4 reply," the chief minister wrote in another Tweet.
