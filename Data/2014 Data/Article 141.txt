Help govt pass bills on which there's consensus: Rahul Gandhi to opposition

NEW DELHI: Interacting with representatives from NGOs, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today asked opposition parties to fix a date to help government pass bills on which there is general consensus.

Some of the delegation members, raising the issue of the disbaled, said when they protest against non-passage of disability bill, water canons are used against them, prompting Gandhi to say "if they tell that they will you chase you away with water canons, you call me to sit with you there."

Leading the pack of NGOs, Nikhil Dey said he fails to understand what is the problem of political parties coming together to pass those bills on which there is a consensus.

"Political parties should fix a day and pass the non-contentious bills after the Vote on Account," Dey said.

Agreeing with the demand, Gandhi said "I will employ my full energy in passing these bills. I am with you and accept cent percent whatever you are saying. Your demands are right. Parliament should run and pass these bills...You continue to do what you are doing. Build public opinion for the bills.

"All these bills can change the country in different ways. These are the consensus bills which will benefit the people of India. I urge the Opposition that decide a day and help us in passing these bills...these are important bills," Gandhi said.

The Congress Vice President interacted with members of different NGOs who were making demands for early passage of the new Disability bill, Street Vendors Bill, Whistleblower Law and others.
