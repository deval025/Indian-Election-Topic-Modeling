JD(U) asks UPA not to take ordinance route on anti-graft bills

KOLKATA: Janata Dal (United) today warned the UPA government not to take the ordinance route on anti-corruption bills before the Lok Sabha elections and urged President Pranab Mukherjee not to give assent if the government went ahead.

"When the Election Commission is to issue notification in a day or two, taking the ordinance route is not only unconstitutional, but also bribing the electorate on the eve of the poll," JD(U) Secretary General and spokesman K C Tyagi told PTI here.

"We will write to the President and also meet the President and urge him not to give assent to the ordinances if the government went ahead with its plan," he said.

"We hope that a person like Pranabda will not give assent," Tyagi, a Rajya Sabha member said.
