Madhusudhan Mistry challenges Narendra Modi for a debate on Gujarat's development

VADODARA: AICC general secretary Madhusudhan Mistry, who has been fielded against BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi for the Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, has dared the latter for a debate over his claims about Gujarat's development.

Congress nominee Narendra Ravat, who was the consensus candidate elected through primary for Vadodara Lok Sabha seat, had withdrawn his candidature yesterday, while the name of Mistry, who had won the 2004 Lok Sabha elections from Sabarkantha, and is at present a Rajya Sabha member, was announced as the candidate from seat.

"I learnt the party's decision on fielding me from Vadodara just yesterday. I thank Congress president Sonia Gandhi, vice president Rahul Gandhi and other party leaders for giving me a chance to fight against Modi for which I had been eagerly waiting for the past several years," Mistry told PTI here today.

"Narendra Modi had never accepted my challenge of contesting Sabarkantha seat in 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha polls," he added.

He alleged that Modi had been misguiding people of the country over development issues.

"Modi is known for misguiding the people. I challenge him to have a debate with me on national issues as well as on Gujarat's so-called development model," he said.

Mistry said his target is to defeat Modi. "And I am very confident about my victory," he said.
