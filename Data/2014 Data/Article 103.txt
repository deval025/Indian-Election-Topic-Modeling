Congress downplays Modi-Powell meeting

NEW DELHI: Congress today downplayed US Ambassador Nancy Powell's meeting with Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi, saying they would not be depressed if he gets an American visa.

"Did we celebrate that he did not get visa? Are we going to be depressed that he got the visa?" External Minister Salman Khurshid asked.

Powell met the BJP's prime ministerial candidate at Gandhinagar, ending a nine-year US boycott of the BJP leader.

"As far as their ambassador or any other diplomat is concerned, they are free in this country to move and get information that helps them to understand India, dynamics of Indian politics better, as we do in their country," Khurshid stated.

The External Affairs Minister also underscored it was the US position on whether to change their stand or not on Modi.

It was for the first time in 13 years that a US Ambassador-level officer travelled to Gandhinagar to meet Modi.

The US has insisted that its policy on granting visa to Modi has not changed.
