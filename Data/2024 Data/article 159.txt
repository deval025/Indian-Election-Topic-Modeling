Electoral trusts since 2014 have also weighed in favour of BJP

The recently released list of corporate contributors to political parties under electoral bonds is under examination, although many of these have been frequent donors, paying large sums to political parties through electoral trusts.

The latest electoral trust data speaks. Five electoral trusts gave political parties ₹366 crore in 2022-23, including ₹259.08 crore going to the ruling BJP.

Megha Engineering and Infrastructure, the second-highest electoral bond giver, also donated Rs 87 crore to Prudent, the richest electoral trust that favours the BJP.

Both electoral bond and electoral trust donor lists include vaccine producer Serum Institute of India and Greenko energy.

Over time, electoral trusts have received donations from Arcelor Mittal, Essel Mining, Vedanta, Airtel Bharti, Torrent, Western UP Power Transmission Co, and real estate giant Navayuga.

Corporate money has also shifted towards BJP in recent years. Political parties' contribution and yearly audit reports reveal BJP getting more electoral bonds.

Since 2013, when Electoral Trust data was made available under new transparency criteria, the situation is similar. Public data on all Electoral Trusts founded between 2002-03 and 2012-13 is unavailable.

The Congress-BJP financial disparity reduced before the 2014 election when the BJP took office.

Satya, now Prudent, the top electoral trust, gave Congress ₹36.5 cr and BJP ₹41.3 cr in FY2013.

This difference grows significantly.

The Prudent Electoral Trust gave 96% of corporate donations to the BJP in FY17. Since then, it has sent the BJP over 85% of its corpus.

Electoral Trusts attracted large Indian companies.

Prudent received funding from Bharti Airtel, DLF, and DCM Shriram. Over time, Torrent Power, Hero MotoCorp, GMR, SII, and others joined, expanding its corpus.

The Tatas, who don't appear in electoral bond statistics, funded political parties through the Progressive Electoral Trust.

Many were shocked when this trust sent the largest amount to the BJP before the 2019 LS polls, ₹356 crores from its ₹800 crore purse. The Congress received no more than Rs 55 crores, while AIADMK and BJD received ₹46 crore and ₹25 crore.

Previously, Reliance was linked to the People's Electoral Trust.

The Aditya Birla groups backs the eponymous the AB General Electoral Trust which has also gravitated to BJP. This Trust gave the BJP its whole ₹10 crore in 2021-22.

After years of supporting the New Democratic Electoral Trust and giving to both parties, the Mahindras are now electoral bond donors.

The Bajaj group has backed the Bajaj Electoral Trust and Vedanta group is earlier known to have backed Janhit Trust. The Samaj Electoral Trust counts the TVS group and the Birlas among its donors.

The Murugappa group helped fund the Triumph electoral trust while Kotak group is associated with the Janta Nirvachak Electoral Trust. The M P Birla group backs the Paribartan electoral trust.

The electoral trust mechanism ensures that the name of the corporate donor is revealed through contribution reports submitted to the poll panel and hence the public, unlike the opacity in case of electoral bonds. Once the key legal corporate funding route, it had been overshadowed by the electoral bond mechanism introduced in 2017.
