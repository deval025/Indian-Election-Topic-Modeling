Electoral Bonds: Keventer group, third largest poll bond buyer, poured total Rs 617 crore

The Jalans of Kolkata have emerged as significant contributors to political parties, ranking third in the nation for their consolidated spending on electoral bonds. Led by Mahendra Kumar Jalan, the MKJ Group, encompassing entities like Keventer Foodpark Infra, Madanlal Ltd, MKJ Enterprises, and Sasmal Infrastructure, has collectively invested a substantial Rs 617 crore on electoral bonds since April 2019.

Keventer Agro, the flagship entity, is involved in various sectors including dairy, packaged food, beverages, FMCG manufacturing, real estate, and steel. Mayank Jalan, son of Mahendra Kumar Jalan, oversees the FMCG division.

Of the Rs 617 crore spent on electoral bonds, Keventer Food Park Infra Ltd procured bonds amounting to Rs 195 crore through three separate transactions held between April and May 2019. Moreover, Keventer Food Park contributed Rs 380.5 crore in 2019, with the remaining sum donated in 2022 and 2023, ToI reported.

In 2017, the West Bengal government divested its 47% stake in Metro Dairy to Keventer Agro, a move that sparked controversy due to subsequent high-value share sales to a Singapore-based private equity firm. This transaction prompted an investigation by the Enforcement Directorate following a petition by West Bengal Congress president Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury.

Chowdhury had alleged that Keventer had bought the stake at a huge discount, causing big losses to the state exchequer.

However, both the Calcutta High Court and the Supreme Court dismissed the appeals. Keventer Agro recorded a revenue of Rs 1,231 crore and an EBITDA of Rs 14.3 crore in the fiscal year 2022-23, according to India Ratings & Research. Madanlal Ltd, another entity under the MKJ Group, reported a total income of Rs 10.85 crore and net profit of Rs 44 lakh for the same fiscal year.

Keventer Agro in its website claims to be ‘third largest in frozen foods in the East’, ‘second largest in ultra-high temperature milk’, ‘second largest in ice cream in Kolkata’ and ‘the leader in branded fresh bananas’.

The company also handles sourcing, manufacturing, and distribution of products of Parle Agro like Frooti and Bailley packaged water across several regions.

Singapore-based Mandala Capital holds around 15% stake in Keventer Agro.

Electoral bonds were terminated by the Supreme Court this year. There was no limit on the quantity of electoral bonds that individuals or corporations could acquire.

Before the introduction of the Electoral Bond Scheme, political parties were required to disclose donations exceeding Rs 20,000. Additionally, corporate entities were restricted from making donations exceeding 7.5% of their total profit or 10% of revenue.

Future Gaming and Hotel Services (Lottery Martin) and Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Ltd lead the list of donors to political parties via electoral bonds.
