Congress' manifesto for Lok Sabha elections to focus on five guarantees, says party President Mallikarjun Kharge

Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge on Tuesday said that the party's manifesto for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections will focus on five guarantees including "Kisan Nyay, Yuva Nyay, Naari Nyay, Shramik Nyay and Hissedari Nyay."

In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Kharge wrote, "The Congress Working Committee (CWC) deliberated thoroughly on the Congress Manifesto, today. The 5 pillars of #BharatJodoNyayYatra - Kisan Nyay, Yuva Nyay, Naari Nyay, Shramik Nyay and Hissedari Nyay have 5 guarantees each."

"Right from 1926, Congress Partyâ€™s Manifesto has been regarded as a "document of trust and commitment" The country is fervently demanding a change. The guarantees currently being touted by the Modi Govt would have the same fate as that of BJP's "India Shining" slogan of 2004. All of us have a responsibility to ensure that our Manifesto gets the widest publicity in different states and our commitment is taken to every household across the country and people at large," the post further stated.

Congress Working Committee met on Tuesday to discuss the party's manifesto for elections starting April 19, 2024. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Congress quoted party General Secretary Jairam Ramesh as saying, "Along with these guarantees, economic policy, foreign policy, constitutional protection, environment and many other justice agenda related to national interest were also discussed in the meeting."
The CWC meeting held today is not just for the manifesto but for our 'Nyay Patra'. The Congress party is ready to liberate the country from the injustice of the last 10 years of BJP. Congress President Shri kharge and RahulGandhi ji have announced 25 guarantees regarding 5 justice in the past days," the post further said.
