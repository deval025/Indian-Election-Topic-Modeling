"Modi's warranty is going to expire": Congress' Jairam Ramesh

Congress General Secretary in-charge of Communications Jairam Ramesh on Tuesday objected to the BJP's slogan 'Modi Ki Guarantee' and claimed that the word 'guarantee' was first used by Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi.

Jairam Ramesh, while speaking to on Tuesday, said the warranty of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's is "going to expire" after the general elections.

"...The guarantees we've given in Telangana and Karnataka are being fulfilled. Where did the word guarantee come from? This is not Narendra Modi's word. Rahul Gandhi had used the term 'guarantee' during Karnataka assembly elections. Jab Modi ki warranty khatam ho rahi hai toh guarantee dene ka kya matlab hai?" he said.

PM Modi is accentuating on 'Modi Guarantee' as a key campaign slogan.

"Modi ki guarantee"--the term was first used by the Prime Minister while inaugurating the Bharat Mandapam in Delhi on July 26--has emerged as the BJP's warranty.

However, earlier too, the leaders of the opposition took a swipe at the 'Modi's guarantee' slogan.

Claiming that "Modi ki guarantee" has a "zero warranty", TMC leader Abhishek Banerjee on Sunday labelled BJP leaders as "outsiders and anti-Bengal," who only visit the state during elections. Banerjee, the TMC national general secretary, asserted that the people of the state will give a befitting reply to the saffron camp during the Lok Sabha elections for withholding the state's funds.

Addressing the 'Jana Garjan Sabha' rally at Brigade Parade grounds, he said, "The 'Modi ki guarantee' has zero warranty. Only Mamata Banerjee and the TMC keep the promises. The BJP and its leaders are outsiders and anti-Bengal and that is why they have withheld the funds due to the state," he said.
