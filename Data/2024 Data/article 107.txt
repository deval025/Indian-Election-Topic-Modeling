"The refugees will receive their citizenship rights. This has been possible for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the entire refugee and Matua communities is indebted to PM Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah. The central government has not put any conditions. We were waiting this to happen for long. Our future generation has been secured by PM Modi," Thakur said.

Joyous celebrations followed in Bongaon's Thakurnagar, Siliguri and other parts of the state following announcements by CAA by the central government. The Matuas are a closely-knit group belonging to the Namashudra (Dalit/SC) community. The sect was founded by Harichand Thakur, who was born at Orakandi in 1812 in erstwhile Bengal.

The Matua community, with its long-time demand for citizenship rights, have demanded implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) for decades. The CAA holds special significance to the Matua community in Bengal, and will work as a vote swinger in Matua belts of Bengal as CAA is implemented in March 2024.

"CAA will help all refugees in all states, not only Matuas in Bongaon and it will reflect in the coming polls in all districts," Matua Mahasangh leader and Bongaon MP Santanu Thakur said. "I will urge this is a security and kavach for our Matua future generations."Minister of States (MoS) under Union Ministry Home Affairs Nisith Pramanik said the CAA is to give citizenship and not take away.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said though "the law was passed in 2020, its implementation before the election announcement shows that it is being done for political reasons."

"CAA will not take citizenship of a single person. It has been prepared for implementation on the ground level. The people, who have lost their citizenship due to religious persecution and got cheated and come to our country, will be benefitted through this. This law is to give citizenship to people and it will not take citizenship," Pramanik assured today in Bengal.
