PM Modi's attack on Opposition in Lok Sabha in his first address after Budget 2024

Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked the Congress party during his first Lok Sabha address after announcement of Interim Budget on Monday and said that the Opposition has resolved to stay in the opposition.

"I appreciate the Opposition's resolve to remain in the opposition for a long time. The way you sat here (in govt) for many decades, the same way you resolve to sit there (in opposition). The public will certainly give you its blessings," PM Modi said during Motion of Thanks on the President's address.

The Prime Minister also said that the opposition has failed to fulfill their responsibility and that the country needs a good opposition.

"Nearly more than 60 MPs have expressed their views on the Motion of Thanks on President's address. I thank all of them. I particularly appreciate the resolve taken by the opposition. From their speech, My confidence and that of the country has become firm that they have decided to be there (on the opposition benches) for long," he added.

Modi, in his address, also took a dig at Congress and said that the nation and the party itself has suffered due to dynasty politics.

He said, "The situation is that (Mallikarjun) Kharge has shifted from this House to that House (Rajya Sabha), and Ghulam Nabi Azad has shifted out of the party. They all became the victims of familyism. Congress' shop is on the verge getting shut in its attempt to launch one product again and again."

"You have left the country disillusioned... Leaders have changed but the same tune continues," he added.

Modi also attacked the INDIA bloc and said, "Alliance ka hi alignment bigad gaya."
