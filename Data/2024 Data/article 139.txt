Hafta vasooli, shell companies & kickbacks: Congress claims poll bond details open a can of worms

The Electoral Commission's big electoral data release is here and its effects are beginning to emerge. The Congress party wasted no time in conducting an initial analysis of the bond data disclosure that was recently made public by the State Bank of India.

Jairam Ramesh, the Congress general secretary, reiterated the party's insistence on the implementation of distinct bond ID numbers to ensure accurate tracking of donors and recipients. Ramesh shared his initial insights on the disclosure of Electoral Bonds data by SBI in a post on X, highlighting the delayed release of this information despite attempts to postpone it until after the election.

Targeting the BJP, the Grand Old Party stated, "Over 1,300 companies and individuals have donated electoral bonds, contributing over 6,000 crores to the saffron party since 2019."

Congress highlighted at least four corrupt tactics of the BJP across four categories: Quid Pro Quo, Hafta Vasooli, Kickbacks, and Money Laundering Through Shell Companies.

There have been numerous instances where companies have made significant donations through electoral bonds (EBs) and received substantial benefits from the government, alleged Congress.

For example, Megha Engineering & Infra contributed over Rs. 800 crores in EBs. In April 2023, they donated Rs. 140 crores, and within a month, they were awarded the lucrative Rs. 14,400 crore Thane-Borivali Twin Tunnel Project.

Similarly, Jindal Steel & Power donated Rs. 25 crores in EBs on 7th October 2022, and merely three days later, they secured the Gare Palma IV/6 coal mine on 10th October 2022.

These instances raise concerns about the potential nexus between corporate donations and government favors, casting a shadow over the transparency and integrity of the electoral process.

Hafta Vasooli: ED, CBI and IT raids
According to Congress, the BJP's strategy of "Hafta Vasooli" follows a straightforward pattern: use agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED), Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), or Income Tax (IT) department to conduct raids on targeted entities, and then coerce them into making "donations" for their protection.

At least 14 out of the top 30 donors have been subjected to such raids.

Earlier this year, an investigation uncovered the unsettling reality that companies, post-raid, were compelled to contribute to the BJP through electoral trusts.

Notably, several of these companies, including Hetero Pharma and Yashoda Hospital, have channeled their donations through Electoral Bonds (EBs).

For instance, in December 2023, Shirdi Sai Electricals underwent an IT department raid, only to donate a hefty sum of Rs. 40 crores through Electoral Bonds the following January. Similarly, Future Gaming & Hotels has emerged as a significant contributor, having donated over Rs. 1200 crore, thus claiming the top spot in donation figures. The chronology reveals a disturbing trend: in April 2022, the ED raided Future, and within five days, they made a hefty Rs. 100 crore donation through EBs.

Then, in October 2023, the IT department conducted another raid on Future, coinciding with a donation of Rs. 65 crores through EBs in the same month. This pattern of raids followed by substantial donations raises serious questions about the integrity of the political funding process.

Kickbacks: A pattern of contributions
A discernible trend emerges from the data, revealing a pattern wherein companies, soon after receiving benefits from the Central government, reciprocate through significant contributions in the form of electoral bonds.

For instance, Vedanta secured the Radhikapur West private coal mine on 3rd March 2021, and merely a month later, in April 2021, they made a substantial donation of Rs. 25 crore through Electoral Bonds.

Similarly, Megha Engineering & Infra clinched the Rs. 4,500 crore Zojila tunnel project in August 2020, followed by a donation of Rs. 20 crore in Electoral Bonds in October 2020.

In another instance, in December 2022, Megha obtained the contract for the BKC bullet train station, promptly contributing Rs. 56 crore in Electoral Bonds during the same month.

This pattern suggests a correlation between governmental benefits granted to companies and their subsequent financial support through electoral bonds, raising questions about the integrity and transparency of the electoral financing system.

Money Laundering via Shell Companies
The electoral bonds scheme has raised significant concerns, primarily due to the removal of restrictions on corporate donations, which opened avenues for shell companies to funnel black money into political funding, said Congress.

One notable instance is the donation of Rs. 410 crore by Qwik Supply Chain Limited, a company with a meager share capital of only Rs. 130 crores as per Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MoCA) filings.

Another critical issue revolves around missing data. Despite the scheme's initiation in March 2018, the State Bank of India (SBI) data provided only begins from April 2019, leaving a significant gap of Rs. 2,500 crores in bond transactions unaccounted for. This absence raises questions about the transparency and accountability of the scheme. For instance, in the initial tranche of bonds, the BJP received 95% of the funds, prompting inquiries into potential biases and favoritism.

As scrutiny into the electoral bonds data persists, it is anticipated that more instances of corruption within the BJP's funding mechanisms will surface. Moreover, there remains a persistent demand for the implementation of unique bond ID numbers to facilitate precise tracking of donors and recipients, thus ensuring greater transparency in political financing.
