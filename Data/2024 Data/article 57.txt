BJP has emphasized Prime Minister Narendra Modi's commitment to positioning India as the 'Vishwa Guru' (world leader) in the global order. Speaking at a press conference, BJP leader Ram Das Malik highlighted the government's dedication to correcting historical wrongs and driving India towards economic growth.

Malik praised the abolition of the Triple Talaq practice, calling it a victory for gender justice and the liberation of Muslim women from an archaic tradition. He credited Prime Minister Modi for empowering millions of women and putting an end to centuries-old practices.

Highlighting the historic move of abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir, Malik described it as a move that restored normalcy to the region. He questioned the Congress party's past inaction and praised Modi's efforts in isolating Pakistan on the global stage.

Malik also highlighted the inauguration of a temple in the UAE and the construction of the grand Shri Ram Temple in Ayodhya. He acknowledged PM Modi's influence on the global stage and the fulfillment of a 500-year-old desire.

Looking ahead, Malik said that the country will achieve significant growth in the agriculture sector through schemes like Kisan Samman Nidhi. He emphasized India's transformation into a manufacturing and knowledge hub, strategically aligned with superpowers and a champion for underdeveloped countries.
