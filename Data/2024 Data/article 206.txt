Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma sets guidelines for 'miya' Muslims seeking indigenous status

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has set forth conditions for migrant Bangladesh-origin Bengali-speaking Muslims, known as "miya," to be acknowledged as indigenous people of the state. Sarma stated, "They should stop having more than two children and practicing polygamy as it is not the culture of Assamese people. If they want to become indigenous, they cannot marry off their minor daughters."

He stressed the importance of education, urging them to send their children to schools instead of madrassas and encouraging them to pursue careers as doctors and engineers. Sarma highlighted the need for cultural assimilation, stating that giving up certain practices and embracing Assamese culture could lead to them being considered indigenous over time.

He also raised concerns about encroachment on 'satras' (Vaishnavite monasteries) land by Bengali-speaking Muslims, questioning their claim to indigeneity.

The Muslim population in Assam is significant, with Muslims accounting for over 34% of the state's total population according to the 2011 census. This population comprises two distinct ethnicities - Bengali-speaking and Bangladesh-origin migrant Muslims, and Assamese-speaking indigenous Muslims.

"Instead of sending your children to madrassas, educate them to become doctors and engineers if you want to be called indigenous," Sarma said, adding, they should also start sending their daughters to schools and give them the right over their fathers' properties.

"These are the differences between them and the indigenous people of the state. If they can give up these practices and imbibe the culture of Assamese people, at some point of time they too can become indigenous," Sarma said.

In 2022, the Assam cabinet recognized approximately 40 lakh Assamese-speaking Muslims as "indigenous Assamese Muslims," distinguishing them from the migrant Bengali-speaking Muslims. This distinction was made to acknowledge the historical and cultural differences between the two groups.

However, a significant portion of the Muslim population in Assam consists of Bangladesh-origin migrants, with Assamese-speaking indigenous Muslims representing only about 37% of the total Muslim population, while the migrant Bengali-speaking Muslims make up the remaining 63%.

The cabinet-approved 'indigenous' Assamese Muslims include five groups - Goria, Moria, Jolah (only those living in tea gardens), Desi, and Syed (only the Assamese-speaking).
