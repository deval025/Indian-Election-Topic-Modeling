Congress has a plan to stop the stray dog menace across the country

The Congress party has announced in its manifesto that it will try to find a solution of the rising stray dogs across the country. In its manifesto, Congress announced that 'the menace of stray dogs has acquired alarming
proportions". "Solutions will be found that will protect humans (especially children) and that are consistent with a humanitarian approach to animals," Congress promised in its manifesto.
Surge in Dog Bite Incidents Sparks Concern
According to recent data released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, incidents of dog bites in India have witnessed a significant 26.5% year-on-year increase. The numbers surged from 2.18 million incidents in 2022 to 2.75 million incidents in 2023. The health ministry's response, presented in the Rajya Sabha, underscores the alarming rise in incidents of stray dog bites, particularly in states like Kerala, Jharkhand, Delhi, Assam, and the union territory of Chandigarh.

The ministry's report indicated that Kerala experienced the most significant increase in dog bite cases, with a staggering 1,486% surge to 63,458 incidents in 2023 from 4,000 incidents in 2022. Meanwhile, Delhi witnessed a 143% year-on-year rise in dog bite cases, totaling 16,133 incidents this year compared to 6,634 incidents in 2022. However, over the past five years, Delhi has seen an 85% decrease in dog bite incidents, dropping from 107,642 cases in 2018 to 16,133 in 2023.

India Grapples With High Rabies Mortality Rates
India currently accounts for a staggering 36% of the world's rabies-related deaths, as per the World Health Organization (WHO). Shockingly, approximately 30% of these victims are children under the age of 15. Distressing visuals of children being attacked by stray dogs frequently surface on social media platforms, intensifying calls for immediate action to address the stray dog issue. Moreover, many incidents of dog bites in children go unreported due to fear.

Tragic Incidents Underscore Urgent Need for Action
Several tragic incidents in recent months have highlighted the urgent need for measures to address the stray dog menace. In one heartbreaking incident last month, a two-year-old girl was allegedly mauled to death by a pack of stray dogs in New Delhi's Tughlaq Lane area. Additionally, various reports have emerged of children sustaining severe injuries after being attacked by dogs in different parts of Delhi. These incidents serve as poignant reminders of the pressing need for effective solutions to mitigate the risks posed by stray dogs.
