Congress Lok Sabha election manifesto: Big promise on restoration of senior citizen travel concessions

In a significant statement, the Congress party said in its Lok Sabha election manifesto on April 5 that if elected, it will restore travel concessions for senior citizens in public transport.
This will be applicable to both rail and road transport facilities, the party said.

It is worth noting here that the Central government, in 2020, had scrapped the concessions granted to senior citizens in public transport facilities, with a view to discouraging the movement of people to arrest the spread of Covid-19.
Before the pandemic, under the rules for senior citizen concession, the Indian Railways used to offer a 40 per cent discount in fares to males aged 60 years or more and 50 per cent to females over the age of 58 years.

Before their withdrawal (on March 20, 2020), these concessions were granted in fares of all classes of Mail/Express/Rajdhani/ Shatabdi/Duranto group of trains.

Operations of Indian Raiways were completely closed during the lockdown. When Railways resumed full-fledged operations in June 2022, the Railway Ministry didn't restore these concessions.

Since then the issue has been raised on various platforms, including in both houses of parliament.
