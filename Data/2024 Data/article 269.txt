The picture in Congress manifesto is Rahul Gandhi's favourite destination, Thailand and Buffalo River in New York: BJP

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has launched a scathing attack on the Congress for including photographs depicting scenes from New York and Thailand in Congress manifesto, raising questions about the seriousness and authenticity of the document.

BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi highlighted the incongruity, stating, "Recently the social media chairperson said she was not aware who was handling her social media account. At least the party should know who was making their manifesto at least." Trivedi emphasized that one of the images used in the Environment section of the manifesto was traced back to Thailand, which he claimed to be a favorite destination of Rahul Gandhi, a prominent figure within the Congress party.

Moreover, the BJP refuted claims made in the manifesto, particularly one by Congress president Kharge regarding India's industrial history. Trivedi asserted, "Congress president Kharge ji said when Congress came to power, not even a needle used to be manufactured in India. This is an absolute lie." He cited historical achievements such as CV Raman's Nobel Prize in 1930 and the establishment of the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru in 1909 as evidence of India's industrial prowess predating the Nehru era.

The Congress manifesto pledges various initiatives, including ensuring the right to apprenticeship, guaranteeing a minimum support price (MSP) legally, and proposing a constitutional amendment to raise the 50 per cent cap on reservations for Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs). However, the BJP dismissed these promises, with a party leader remarking, "They have called the manifesto Nyay Patra after doing injustice to all sections of the country for all these years."

The BJP's criticism extended beyond the factual accuracy of the manifesto to its alleged lack of credibility and coherence. Trivedi expressed concern over the use of foreign images, suggesting a broader narrative of the Congress party's alleged habit of "borrowing" foreign narratives. "Until now, they have been going abroad and defaming India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But now they are borrowing foreign photos for their manifesto," he remarked.

Furthermore, Trivedi highlighted the Congress party's track record in fulfilling manifesto promises, both at the central and state levels, implying skepticism regarding the feasibility of the pledges outlined in the document.

In response to the manifesto, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma questioned the origin of its content, insinuating potential involvement of foreign entities in its drafting. Sarma criticized various aspects of the manifesto, including its ambiguity regarding delivery timelines for promises and its failure to articulate a plan to leverage the benefits of Industry 4.0.

The unveiling of the Congress manifesto for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections has thus ignited a fierce exchange of criticisms between the ruling BJP and the opposition party, setting the stage for intense political discourse in the lead-up to the elections.
