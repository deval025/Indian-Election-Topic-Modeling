"Jobs lying vacant at PM's own office...": Rahul Gandhi takes a dig at BJP's Modi ki Guarantee punchline

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, in his latest jibe at Modi, has pointed out that many key posts are lying vacant at the PM's own office. In a March 4 X post, Gandhi took a dig at the BJP punchline "Modi ki Guarantee", asking India's youth to take note of the man "carrying a bag of false promises".

Narendra Modi's intention is not to provide employment; let alone create new posts, the PM is sitting on a lot of vacant jobs at his own office, Gandhi quipped.

Why are a large number of very important posts vacant in the Prime Minister's own office, Gandhi questioned in his X post. Who is carrying a 'bag of false guarantees', the Congress leader asked.

To support his argument on the general lack of jobs, Gandhi cited some of the govt's own data, highlighting that 9 lakh 64 thousand posts are vacant in 78 departments of the govt.

"If we look at important departments only, 2.93 lakh posts are vacant in Railways, 1.43 lakh in Home Ministry and 2.64 lakh in Defence Ministry," the Congress leader said.

Does the Central Government have the answer as to why more than 30% posts are vacant in 15 major departments, Gandhi asked.

He said that the BJP government considers providing permanent jobs a burden. That is why the govt is continuously promoting the contract system, "where there is neither security nor respect", he added.

The vacant posts are the right of the youth of the country and INDIA block has prepared a concrete plan to fill them, Gandhi said.

India's resolve is that we will open closed doors of jobs for the youth; the destiny of the youth is about to rise after breaking the darkness of unemployment, he added.
