India has an unbroken culture of democracy: PM Modi
New Delhi: India has an ancient and unbroken culture of democracy, and has been the lifeblood of the Indian civilization, PM Narendra Modi said on Wednesday.

Addressing the leaders' plenary of 3rd Summit for Democracy, he emphasised that consensus building, open dialogue and free discussions have resonated throughout India's history, adding, "That is why my fellow citizens consider India to be the mother of democracy.

"Over the last decade, India has moved forward with the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Viswas, Sabka Prayas.' We have transitioned to a performance-based governance where shortages, corruption and discrimination have been replaced by transparency, accountability and opportunity," the PM pointed out. He suggested that democratic countries should lead the efforts in making international systems and institutions more inclusive, democratised, participative and fair.

"...in a few weeks from now, the world will witness the largest festival of democracy in India, with around one billion voters expected to vote. This will be the largest electoral exercise in the history of mankind. The people of India will once again affirm their faith in democracy," the PM added.

Earlier delivering India's national statement at the summit, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar stated that India's commitment to conducting free, fair and inclusive elections underscores the resilience and adaptability of its democratic machinery, illustrating that even amidst complexity, the voice of every citizen matters.
