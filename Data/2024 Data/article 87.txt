BJP spreading lies about Sandeshkhali: Mamata Banerjee

Kolkata: A day after Prime Minister Narendra said a "storm of Sandeshkhali will sweep Bengal" and decimate the ruling party, Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee on Thursday met a group of women from Sandeshkhali and accused the BJP of spreading lies about her party.

Asserting that Bengal was the safest place for women, Banerjee hit out at PM Modi, asking why is the BJP silent on Bilkis Bano, Hathras rape case of UP, women of Manipur and women athletes who have accused BJP leader and WFI president of sexual assault.

Banerjee said that a "political tornado" will rise against the BJP while claiming that the BJP is angry with the Trinamool as the party doesn't allow divisive politics in Bengal.

"False sandesh (message) has been spread about Sandeshkhali. A few incidents happened and we have taken action immediately. I don't hesitate to arrest Trinamool workers if they are at fault," the chief minister said.

"Why are they so angry with Bengal? Even yesterday, they lied saying Bengal is most unsafe for women. I can challenge them that Bengal is the safest for women while justice for women in BJP-ruled states like UP, Bihar, Rajasthan, or Manipur is not offered," Banerjee said.
