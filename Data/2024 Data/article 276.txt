2024 Lok Sabha Election: Congress still in struggle mode in Delhi

Congress is struggling to finalise candidates for the three Delhi Lok Sabha seats it is contesting in alliance with AAP. The bone of contention seems to be Chandni Chowk. Former Congress CM Sheila Dikshit's son has staked claim to it, from where former Delhi unit chief JP Aggarwal has fought. The high command is confused with the request since Sandeep has represented North East Delhi and his mother has fought from there.

The AAP and Congress are part of the opposition INDIA alliance. The AAP will contest four Lok Sabha seats from the national capital, while the Congress will field candidates from three.

The AAP will contest four seats - New Delhi, South Delhi, West Delhi and East Delhi - while the Congress candidates will fight the polls from Chandni Chowk, North East Delhi, and North West constituencies.

Lok Sabha elections in Delhi will be held in the sixth and penultimate phase on May 25, the Election Commission announced on Saturday.

In 2019, the BJP candidates won all seven seats and the votes polled by them were more than the combined tallies of the Congress and AAP candidates.

However, this time, the Congress and AAP plan to throw a spanner in the BJP's works.
