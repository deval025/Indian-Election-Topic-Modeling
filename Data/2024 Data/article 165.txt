Modi begins South push with rallies, road show

A day ahead of announcement of 2024 poll schedule, Prime Minister Narendra Modi started his South push and adressed a rally each in Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
It was followed by his road show in Telangana.

The BJP sees more wins in the southern states as crucial to achieving its target of 370 seats in the Lok Sabha and ensuring a third term for the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at the Centre.

Party sources said a programme is being chalked out for Modi's March 15 to 19 southern India campaign, which will include at least two public events each day.

He is expected to address three programmes in Tamil Nadu and two in Kerala.

On March 17, Modi is likely to address a NDA rally at Palnadu in Andhra Pradesh, where he after a long time would share stage with TDP supremo N Chandrababu Naidu.

TDP moved out of NDA in 2019 and fought Lok Sabha polls in alliance with Congress.

In Tamil Nadu, Modi is likely to address another public meeting in Salem on March 16 and hold a roadshow in Coimbatore on the 18th.

During his Tamil Nadu visit, Modi may hold meetings with NDA partners regarding Lok Sabha polls.

In Kerala, Modi is likely to hold a roadshow in Pallakad besides Friday's rally in Pathanamthitta. The BJP's Karnataka unit has proposed programmes for Modi in Shimoga and Gulbarga in coming days. Similar requests have come from the party's Andhra Pradesh and Telangana units, too. These include an NDA rally in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh, where he may share the stage with TDP and Jan Sena leaders.
