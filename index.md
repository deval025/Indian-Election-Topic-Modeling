**"Comparative Topic Modeling of Indian Elections: A Decadal Analysis of Media Coverage"**  
By *Deval Patel, Radboud Universiteit, Nijmegen*

## üìÑ Abstract
Elections significantly influence a country‚Äôs political landscape, with media playing a pivotal role in shaping public discourse. This study analyzes media coverage of the 2014 and 2024 Indian general elections using Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to uncover thematic differences across a decade. Persistent themes like economic development were identified, alongside new issues in 2024, including unemployment, caste census, and farmers‚Äô concerns. Validation against election manifestos and Wikipedia articles confirmed the relevance of generated topics, though certain manifesto priorities were underrepresented. The findings highlight how media narratives adapt to changing political contexts, offering insights into the interplay between media and democracy.
